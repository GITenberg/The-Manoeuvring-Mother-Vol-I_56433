<p>Sir John and Lady Wetheral were blessed
with four fine little girls, who promised to be
all the fond heart of a parent could wish; for,
as her ladyship observed with pride, "their
forms were perfect, and their features were
faultless." There was no exuberance of shape
to rectify, there was no limb distorted, and,
above all, there were no thick ankles, or
dumpy-looking hands to shock a refined taste.
The four girls were sprightly, lovely little
beings, who would in due time create an immense
sensation, and ultimately form connexions
with noblemen, or with "county
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
kings," which was even more desirable. Sir
Watkin Williams Wynn was considered
"Prince of Wales," and there were one or
two gentlemen who might claim the title of
King of Shropshire, if immense property conferred
that title. The Miss Wetherals were
born distinguished looking, and their career
would be triumphant. Lady Wetheral loved
also an even number; <i>four</i> daughters were
not too alarming: five or three would have
been an indefinite half-vulgar fraction. Her
ladyship hated any thing vulgar.</p>

<p>But events are not in our own hands; and
the systems we prepare and digest with patient
calculation are overturned in one luckless
moment by unforeseen circumstances.
Lady Wetheral had scarcely decided in her
own mind, that five daughters were an indefinite
vulgarity, when another helpless innocent
appeared to crush her hopes, and disturb
her tranquillity. This was, indeed, a blow.
All fear of increasing her family had passed
from Lady Wetheral's mind so completely,
that it was an overpowering disappointment.
Five years had stolen away since the birth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Clara, and now to recommence the troubles
and miseries of nursing, with an uncertain
vista before her! Suppose she had twelve?
suppose she had fifteen? suppose she had
five-and-twenty? where might all this end? How
very provoking and vexatious!</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral felt it was vain to utter
lamentations: she must lie up, and take care
of herself, and avoid the children's noise, and
do exactly as she had done before under the
same affliction. It <i>might</i> prove an heir. If
so, her ladyship would not complain: a son
would secure the entailed property, and keep
up the family name and honours. The name
of Wetheral would be extinguished, unless a
son resumed the honourable title after poor
Sir John was gone, and a fine aristocratic-looking
boy ranging through the castle would
be a proud sight, certainly. He might marry
a duke's heiress. Yes, a magnificent boy
<i>would</i> be welcomed.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed Lady Wetheral's
chagrin at giving birth in due time to a
daughter. Her anger was scarcely repressed
by her command of temper, or by the lectures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of her unworldly husband. Lady Wetheral
loved her husband with the utmost propriety,
too, and never acted in decided opposition to
his expressed wishes, but she turned in disgust
from his arguments, and generally contrived
to man&#339;uvre his good nature into an
unwilling approval of her plans, by unceasing
fluency, and a code of principles, which bewildered
and silenced him. Sir John Wetheral
only endured the fate of many husbands,
who are linked with "remarkably chatty
clever women:" he objected, demurred, and
gradually yielded to views which he disapproved,
but could never successfully combat.
His first visit to his lady's chamber, after the
unwelcome little stranger's appearance upon
the stage of life, was characteristic, and displayed
the principles which influenced the
heart and conduct of each parent.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir John, shake hands, love; but
we need not congratulate each other. I did
hope a son might have repaid me for all this
annoyance, but here is another wretched girl,
and the little animal looks determined to live."</p>

<p>"Glad of it, Gertrude," and Sir John Wetheral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
stroked its little cheek gently and
fondly.</p>

<p>"How can you say so, my love! I have
made arrangements for my four girls, which
had comfortably and completely satisfied my
mind, but this child is an excrescence, which
destroys my comfort entirely."</p>

<p>"Include her in your arrangements, my
dear."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Sir John! Anna Maria will
be out in five years, and I have arranged that
she shall marry Tom Pynsent."</p>

<p>"Tom devil!" cried Sir John Wetheral,
impatiently.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral possessed the enviable faculty
of becoming deaf to observations and
epithets, which did not harmonize with her
opinions. She did not, therefore, hear her
husband's exclamation, but proceeded in a
languid tone of voice.</p>

<p>"Isabel I have resolved to give in proper
time to Charles Bligh, who will be a
baronet when she appears in public, for I am
sure old Sir Charles is dropsical; and, if that
poor sickly Lord Ennismore lives to come of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
age, he will do for Julia. Clara is a handsome
girl, and I look very high for <i>her</i>, but I
never dreamed of having another plague upon
my hands. I quite made up my mind it was
to be a son, and this unlooked-for disappointment
worries me to death."</p>

<p>"You are always calculating, Gertrude.
You are always sketching out folly, and
scheming plans for future mortification. Who
the deuce would talk of Tom Pynsent, who is
just sent off to school, or of Charles Bligh,
whom we have never seen, or of Lord Ennismore,
who can't live a twelvemonth, and of
poor Clara, who is destined for the man in the
moon! Prove yourself a good wife and mother,
my dear, and leave the children's destinies
to develop themselves as God pleases."</p>

<p>"You men, my love, are very indolent, and
always trust to casualities: I never do."</p>

<p>"How the deuce are you to catch Tom Pynsent,
Gertrude? If you ladies begin intriguing
so early&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral waved her hand languidly.
"Don't express yourself so coarsely, my love."</p>

<p>"Your manner is refined, I confess,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
answered her husband, smiling, "but your
matter is equally coarse with the speech you
deprecate: you are already appropriating your
children, without considering their affections,
or the characters of the boys you are designing
for them so placidly. As far as I can
judge, Tom Pynsent is a blackguard."</p>

<p>"Never mind that, my love: boys and men
are very different beings. My arrangements
are complete on the score of my four daughters'
ultimate success, but this unfortunate
child is a bar sinister. Her birth will lessen
my girls' fortunes."</p>

<p>"She shall be my own child, and my own
care," returned Sir John Wetheral.</p>

<p>"By all means, love, and a pretty mess you
will make of it: I dare say she will be a
'Jack,' or a very decided young lady, as all
girls are who are petted by fathers; but my
daughters will be disposed of before she quits
the nursery, therefore, her example will not
influence their characters."</p>

<p>"What is her name to be?" asked Sir
John, as he fondled the infant in his arms,
and kissed its cheek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Call her what you please, Sir John; she
is to be your care now, not mine. If you
think a name necessary, let it be your own
choice."</p>

<p>"Then I name her Christobel, after my
good old aunt, Gertrude."</p>

<p>"A delightful name, my love, and after an
excellent model. Christobel was a heavenly-minded,
frightful old maid, and your fifth
daughter may resemble her in every respect."</p>

<p>"Let it be so. My aunt was a woman of
strong affections, and of powerful abilities,
and, if this child possesses half her excellence,
she will be a treasure to me in my old age."</p>

<p>"I dare say she will be a great comfort to
you, love," said Lady Wetheral, in a sleepy
tone, "but, suppose the nurse is summoned
for Miss Christobel&mdash;I am inclined to sleep."</p>

<p>The child was soon taken from Lady Wetheral's
arms, and consigned to the distant
apartment which constituted the nursery. Sir
John also rose to depart, but his lady's languid
voice detained him.</p>

<p>"Sir John!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I shall require change of air after
all this."</p>

<p>"Certainly; where would you like to move?
Shall we go to the sea-side?"</p>

<p>"No, love, the sea air is too keen; but I
half promised the Tyndals to pay them a visit
after my confinement."</p>

<p>"The infant will inconvenience them in
their present house, Gertrude."</p>

<p>"I do not mean to take the infant, Sir
John, on that account; besides, my nights
would be dreadfully disturbed; no, I shall
leave Christobel with you, love, and only take
Anna Maria with me for a fortnight."</p>

<p>"I am not included in your 'arrangements',
then?"</p>

<p>"My love, you know I require great quiet,
and at the Tyndals every thing is so agreeably
methodical and peaceful, I shall recover my
strength quickly; then, you know, dear, the
Pynsents live within a short drive; I shall,
perhaps, see a great deal of the Pynsents."</p>

<p>"That will be a nuisance, certainly, as you
do not like Mrs. Pynsent, but you will not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
disturbed by her frequent visits, for the disinclination
is mutual."</p>

<p>"You are so obtuse, love. I am going to
the Tyndals on purpose to renew my acquaintance
with Mrs. Pynsent, and I trust we
shall be very intimate."</p>

<p>"What, with the woman you denounce as
vulgar, and contradictory?"</p>

<p>"I have argued these things with you, Sir
John, till my patience is nearly exhausted,
and you are still benighted on a subject so
closely interwoven with my happiness. I
tell you I am going on purpose to effect a
scheme, and I take Anna Maria with me, to
prepossess Mrs. Pynsent in her favour."</p>

<p>"And what the deuce, Gertrude, makes
you wish to prepossess a woman so disagreeable
as you describe Mrs. Pynsent to be?
Why can't you keep away?"</p>

<p>"My love, I tell you Anna Maria is destined
for Tom."</p>

<p>"And what has Tom to do with his
mother? He is at Eton. You had better
take lodgings near Eton, if you want to catch
Tom."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can argue with you no more, Sir John.
Your ideas are so very limited, it is impossible
to graft a plan upon them. It is well
your daughters have a mother who is anxious
to establish them in life, since their father
would effect nothing. If I was on my death-bed,
my last hours would be horrified by
visions of my daughters' pairing off with
curates or lieutenants."</p>

<p>"And pray, where do you look for future
bishops and Wellingtons, but among curates
and lieutenants?" cried Sir John, warmly.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Sir John, you make me sick with
your levelling principles," retorted Lady Wetheral,
rising in her bed; "my health is far
from strong; you have given me a severe headache,
and I do request you will never again
breathe the word 'curate;' it puts such
wretched thoughts into my mind. Fancy
Anna Maria shuffling after a fat country
curate, smelling of onions, and bawling at
a row of charity-children! or, Julia married
to your friend Leslie, handing her basket
upon a baggage-waggon! Pray, my love,
send Thompson to me with some tea, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
never let this disagreeable subject be renewed
between us. I think I am very poorly."</p>

<p>Sir John was long habituated to resign his
opinions when they affected his lady's health;
and, on this occasion, he renounced them
with his usual good humour.</p>

<p>"Well, Gertrude, get rid of your aches
and pains, and you shall become intimate with
Mrs. Pynsent, and catch her son Tom, if it
will give you pleasure. I don't like to see
you nervous and ill."</p>

<p>"And my love," continued her ladyship,
who saw the happy moment was attained for
enforcing her wishes, "do not use that very
coarse expression 'catch.' You always tell
me I am resolved to 'catch' Tom Pynsent.
I do not like the word."</p>

<p>"But you say, Gertrude, you mean to give
him to Anna Maria; surely you must catch
him first."</p>

<p>"We ought never to express ourselves
coarsely, my love. I certainly do mean to
make Tom my son-in-law, but I have no intention
of seizing his person. I did not
think <i>you</i> were roughly handled but my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
mother decided upon your becoming my
husband long before you addressed me."</p>

<p>"She did, did she?"</p>

<p>"To be sure, and you fell into the snare
as agreeably as Pynsent will walk into mine.
My mother always said that men were puppets
if we concealed the wires, and I believe
she was right."</p>

<p>Sir John hummed an opera air, and withdrew.
Lady Wetheral sunk into pleasing
meditations, and was roused by Thompson
appearing with a salver, bearing its delicate
porcelain. Thompson was instantly under
orders.</p>

<p>"I will not drink my tea strong, Thompson,
that will do. How are Miss Anna
Maria's hands? Do you use the almond-paste
every evening?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, my lady, and she wears her thick
veil doubled over her face when she takes the
air."</p>

<p>"Very well. I am going to Court Herbert,
as soon as I can quit the house with
propriety, and I mean to take my eldest
daughter with me; therefore, Thompson, I
wish her to look well, and during this cold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
weather I wish her to remain altogether in
the nursery; the wind will give her that blue
look which I cannot endure. Then I wish
her not to cry much, which always destroys
the complexion; so do not let her fight about
with her sisters, but amuse her in your room."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lady."</p>

<p>"Let her lie down two or three hours
every day, Thompson, for it makes a girl
grow straight, and let her dine upon chicken
only. Don't vulgarise her with nasty brown
meats."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lady."</p>

<p>"And see, Thompson, that Miss Anna
Maria keeps on her gloves, and don't allow
her to jump and play about. I particularly
wish her to look delicate and ladylike at
Court Herbert."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, my lady; and then Hatton is so
near, perhaps she will see Master Pynsent."</p>

<p>"All in good time, Thompson. I thought
I had something more to say&mdash;oh, don't let
her drink large draughts of any thing, it
swells the stomach; and keep her in your
room altogether, for she may learn odd words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
from the nursery-maids, and that would distract
me."</p>

<p>"I will remove her from the nursery immediately,
my lady," replied the obedient
Thompson.</p>

<p>"There now, take every thing away, and
keep the door shut, that I may not hear the
baby scream. I suppose the nurse is healthy,
and all that, Thompson?"</p>

<p>"I believe so, my lady."</p>

<p>"Very well, I think I am going to sleep
now, so do not come near me till I ring."</p>

<p>Thompson departed with stealthy steps,
and closed the scarlet baized doors which
separated the nursery apartments from the
wing which contained her lady's boudoir and
sleeping chamber; but no precautions could
deaden the piercing screams which issued
from the unfortunate Anna Maria during the
operation of transplanting her little person
from the pleasures of companionship to the
desolate advantages of Thompson's sitting-room.</p>

<p>Rage crimsoned every feature, and swelled
her little heart almost to bursting. In vain
Thompson assured the angry girl how necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the translation would prove towards
her future establishment&mdash;how impossible
it was for a young lady to succeed in after
life if her hands were purple, and her nose
red, with giving way to excessive emotion.
Anna Maria became more intractable,
and her three sisters advocated her cause.
There was an "emeute" in the nurseries of
Wetheral Castle. Anna Maria screamed
violently, and the shrill sound was caught up
and perpetuated by her party. Thompson
was at fault, but she tried to gain time by
the protocol system.</p>

<p>"Listen, my dear Miss Anna Maria,
while I explain to you the system your
mamma wishes you to pursue."</p>

<p>"I won't listen!" screamed Anna Maria.</p>

<p>"We won't listen!" shouted her supporters.</p>

<p>"Then you will never marry Master Pynsent,"
cried Thompson, with incautious indignation.</p>

<p>This threat raised the defiance of the
whole group, and the tumult became deafening.
A bell rang violently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, young ladies!" exclaimed Thompson,
"now you will get into a fine scrape!"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral was scandalized at the
rude sounds which had penetrated into her
chamber, and Thompson's statement utterly
confounded her.</p>

<p>"I am sure, Thompson, I do not know
how to make arrangements for such conduct.
I suppose they must have their own way,
which is very disagreeable, but you know I
cannot produce Miss Anna Maria at Court
Herbert, with swelled features and a sulky
face. Let her do as she likes then, Thompson;
we can't help ourselves."</p>

<p>Thus ended the insurrection in Wetheral
Castle, which even the infant appeared to enjoy,
as it crowed, and nearly kicked itself out
of her nurse's arms, when the tumult was
loudest. She then predicted it would delight
in stirring sounds, and become a fearless
character.</p>

<p>This <i>emeute</i> produced serious results, which
Lady Wetheral had not anticipated, but
which ever succeeds to power wielded by weak
and unsteady hands. Miss Anna Maria became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
gradually dictator, and maintained her
opinions and determinations with such unshaken
obstinacy, that her mother as gradually
resigned her will, and submitted to
the imperious dictates of her eldest daughter.
Her mind was exclusively bent upon securing
Tom Pynsent; and, in the anxious hope of
forwarding her plans, she suffered her power
to depart into other hands, and beheld her own
children forming a strong party in opposition
to all her expressed opinions. She lamented
her weakness when too late, to Thompson.</p>

<p>"The young ladies, Thompson, put me
quite on the shelf, and oppose me in every
thing. They will never marry properly.
Anna Maria's hands are not so white as they
were when I could insist upon her wearing
gloves; and Julia's feet are getting extremely
broad. She will insist upon walking in easy
shoes. All my arrangements are useless;
and it makes me miserable to find Sir John as
lax as ever in his notions. What a thing he
will make of that ugly little Christobel!"</p>

<p>"Every one thinks, my lady, little Miss
Chrissy will turn out a very fine child," said
poor Thompson, who detested the new dynasty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense, Thompson, don't tell me any
thing called Christobel can be decent-looking;
and, as I do not attend to her, I am sure her
hands and feet will be unproducible, but I
never trouble myself about it, for she is Sir
John's pet; and men's pets are always masculine,
coarse women. Perhaps, when Anna
Maria is Mrs. Pynsent, she will introduce
her sister to somebody who may not object
to a coarse kind of wife; but, I confess, I
have no hopes for a young woman called
Christobel, and named, too, after a frightful
spinster."</p>

<p>This latter conversation took place on the
eve of Anna Maria's introduction, five years
subsequent to the rebellion which decided the
downfall of Lady Wetheral's power, and
transferred the sceptre into the hands of her
children. The daily occurrences of the nursery
are marked by sameness; there is little
to vary its routine. Let us turn now to the
period when the lives of the sisters began to
take their colouring from the sentiments of
their parents, and to suffer the trials and sorrows
incidental to existence.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>The introduction of Miss Wetheral produced
an immense sensation in Wetheral
Castle. Nothing could exceed Lady Wetheral's
delight in the confusion of selecting
becoming articles of dress. How great was
her pride of heart, her smile of triumph,
as she gazed upon Anna Maria in her gay
apparel, preparing for her first <i>entrée</i> into
public! Yet, the occasion was melancholy,
and ill-suited to be the chosen hour to launch
youth and beauty upon the ocean of life.</p>

<p>It was at an assize-ball, at Shrewsbury,
then the metropolis of the north midland
counties, where Miss Wetheral burst upon
the astonished sight. When the wretched
felon, under sentence of death, lay languishing
in his cell, awaiting the approaching hour
of execution; while the clergyman was speaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
hope to the soul, and leading the despairing
heart to rest for forgiveness on the mercy
and sufferings of its Redeemer; then did the
irons which bound his trembling hands vibrate
to the roar of carriages which rolled
rapidly and furiously to the scene of festivity.
Then did the neighbouring country pour forth
her highest and loveliest; and the moans of
repentant sinners, on the verge of ascending
the scaffold, were forgotten in the brilliant
throng, and lost in the lively repartee, or well-turned
compliment.</p>

<p>The assize-ball was then the arena for debutants;
the one green spot which decorated
the dullness of a long twelvemonth; the hope,
the anxiety of hundreds. That ill-judged
hour for gaiety is now consigned to silence.
The march of intellect has trodden down <i>that</i>
unholy practice, and given an outward semblance,
at least, of better feelings. It is assuredly
better taste.</p>

<p>It was a proud moment when Anna Maria
visited the nursery, to display her first ball
dress, and receive expressions of wonder
and delight at her appearance. The sisters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
broke from their romps to examine the ornaments
which glittered on her neck; and a row
of maid-servants, who were introduced into the
nursery to see Miss Wetheral, curtseyed in
profound admiration. She was indeed a
creature to be gazed at. Isabel received an
incurable wound upon her peace from the interview,
and never more returned to her once
happy games of puss in the corner. Anna
Maria was but one year her senior, yet she
was dressed in muslin and satin, wore a diamond
necklace, and had been to the assize-ball.
Why could not she also partake in such
delights? Why was she to play with her
sisters in the nursery, while Anna Maria was
dancing at assize-balls?</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral tried to argue Isabel into
docility, but her mind could not perceive the
sense of her parent's reasoning. "My dear
child, your sister will soon marry, and then
you will appear in her place. You know nothing
is so inconvenient as having two daughters
out at the same time. While gentlemen
are disputing which is the best looking,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the young ladies lose their novelty, and
cannot expect to marry well."</p>

<p>"But, mamma, I don't want to marry; I
want to dance, and look as handsomely-dressed
as Anna Maria did at the assize-ball."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Isabel! you are as pertinacious
as your father, and just as blind. Wait till
your sister is married, and she will introduce
you. Perhaps next year may produce wonders;
your sister is exceedingly admired."</p>

<p>"So she <i>may</i> be, while I am out. I shall
not interfere with her, you know, for I shall
be dancing all the time."</p>

<p>"I cannot argue with such a limited intellect
as you appear to possess, Isabel. I
have made my arrangements, and cannot break
through them. You will appear when your
sister is Mrs. Pynsent. Tom Pynsent was
very attentive to Anna Maria at the ball."</p>

<p>"Then I'll beg Tom Pynsent to make
haste, I declare!" exclaimed Isabel.</p>

<p>"Do not be vulgar and unladylike, Isabel,
and promise me you will make no coarse allusions
to Tom Pynsent. I should be extremely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
shocked at such a line of conduct.
I do not absolutely say Anna Maria <i>will</i>
secure Tom, but I trust and hope such an
event is in fruition; and if so, you shall immediately
be brought forward. Two girls
out at once is folly."</p>

<p>Isabel was nothing daunted by her mother's
objection; and she returned openly and constantly
to the attack, which soon exhausted
the few efficient reasons urged by her antagonist.
An incident at once decided the propriety
of stopping the mouth of an alarming
witness, and put an end to further discussion.
Isabel was allowed to descend into the drawing-room,
after Anna Maria's début, as Lady
Wetheral observed it would prove a judicious
step towards giving her manner its first polish;
and the transition from the nursery to the
trials of society would be less felt by a gradual
initiation into its forms.</p>

<p>Isabel was not to converse, or offer an
opinion, upon any subject; she was not in
any wise to infringe upon her sister's prerogative,
or draw attention towards herself;
but she was to observe silently the proprieties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of life&mdash;to learn by close attention the observances,
the graceful bend of reception, the
easy flow of local conversation, and the thousand
agreeable nothings comprised in receiving
company. Upon all this was Isabel to meditate;
but no silly compliment offered by a
young man was to be understood or replied
to by herself; no gracious invitation was to
be accepted, no remark whatsoever was to
induce her to put herself forward. Upon
these hard terms, Isabel was received in her
mother's apartments; and she endured the
sight of her "senior by only one year," receiving
the crowds which frequented Wetheral
Castle, dressed with elegance, admired,
courted, and surrounded with flattery in all
its proteus forms.</p>

<p>Isabel long suffered the keen feelings of
envy to war in her heart; not envy towards
Anna Maria, whom she equally admired and
loved&mdash;but envy of that state which she
longed ardently to partake. In one hapless
hour, Isabel forgot her vow of silence, and
spoke, as most backward young ladies <i>will</i>
speak, when pressed beyond endurance, most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
rashly and unadvisedly. Lady Spottiswoode
and her daughter had been long dilating on the
forthcoming races, and the full ordinary and
ball which every one anticipated, when Miss
Spottiswoode, turning to Isabel, asked when
they should have the pleasure of including her
among the gay young ladies. Isabel, thrown
off her guard by the question, instantly replied,
colouring with her earnest feelings&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! Miss Spottiswoode, I hope I shall
soon be out; but it depends upon Anna
Maria's marrying Tom Pynsent." Lady Wetheral
for one instant completely lost her self-possession.
Sir John laughed aloud. The
Spottiswoodes were too delicate to take notice
of the remark. They rose and examined
some portfolios of prints which lay upon the
table, and endeavoured to change the current
of thought, by again dwelling upon the
ordinary and race-ball; but the shock was too
severely felt to be easily overcome. There
was a painful silence, and the Spottiswoodes
kindly took their leave.</p>

<p>"There!" said Lady Wetheral, applying the
vinaigrette to her nose, "Lady Spottiswoode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
is gone to report my arrangements to the
world, and Isabel's stupid folly has occasioned
it. Did I not insist upon her silence?"</p>

<p>"You should have taught your girls discretion,
Gertrude," replied Sir John, "by
being discreet yourself. Why did you commit
your arrangements, as you call them, to
the keeping of a child who is suffering under
them? You should teach them to practise
the art of speaking, before you thrust your
children headlong from the nursery into company.
You are rightly served: this will
prevent all future mistakes."</p>

<p>"You may say what you please, Sir John;
I cannot exhaust myself by arguing with such
very limited ideas. I am very ill, and extremely
shocked at Isabel's conduct: pray let
her attend the race-ball, or do what she likes:
I am unequal to combat determined obstinacy."</p>

<p>"May I go to the race-ball, then? Shall
I go out with Anna Maria, and see her admired,
and dance myself for hours together?"
exclaimed Isabel, throwing herself on her
knees in a transport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go just where you like," replied her mother,
languidly; "you will be stupid and
vulgar whenever you emerge, therefore time
or place is a matter of little moment. Take
your own way, for my authority is quite set
aside."</p>

<p>Up rose Isabel, attentive only to the words
which pronounced her release, and, bounding
round the room, careless of remark, she rushed
upstairs to make known her triumph.</p>

<p>"Thompson, Thompson! I am going to the
race-ball in July. I am to go out with Anna
Maria, and dance like mad! here goes!"</p>

<p>And Isabel began dancing round the nursery
in the wildest spirits, imitating, to the
best of her ability, Anna Maria's elegant
manner and step.</p>

<p>Thus was Lady Wetheral a second time
defeated in the nearest wish of her heart; but
her resentment only extended to keeping her
bed for two days, during which she complained
to Thompson of illness and excessively shocked
feelings. On the third day, she was eagerly
and agreeably employed in selecting a proper
wardrobe for Isabel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>There could not be a more striking contrast
than that which was displayed in the person
and manners of the two elder sisters, and their
effect upon society was equally distinct. Anna
Maria concealed an irritable temper under
an exterior peculiarly elegant, and manners
strikingly gentle and fascinating: her popularity,
therefore, was great, and her steps
attended by admirers of both sex, who were
drawn towards her by the force of extreme
sweetness of manner. All men toasted the
lovely Miss Wetheral, and all women confessed
she was agreeable as she was charming,
yet Anna Maria passed on her way without
receiving offers from one sex, or forming a
friendship with an individual of the other.</p>

<p>Isabel's artless high spirits and warm heart
was, on the other hand, misunderstood, and
few did her justice in public. She danced too
much, and laughed too loud, and gentlemen
sought her often as an agreeable relief from
the refined insipidity of her companions, which
told against her in society. Lady Wetheral
cautioned her in vain.</p>

<p>"I wish, Isabel, you would not jump so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
high, and look so pleased with your partners;
it is quite inelegant, and will make you disliked.
No other young lady looks pleased,
and the gentlemen get grinning and talking
round you, to the exclusion of your sister and
many others. Pray refrain."</p>

<p>"It is my nature to be happy," replied
Isabel, laughing, "and my friends may out-talk
me if they like. I only desire to chat
and enjoy myself in peace."</p>

<p>"For shame, Isabel! you are not aware
how you create enemies by such conduct. I
was ashamed to see you racing down the middle
and up again, with Tom Pynsent, at Lady
Spottiswoode's carpet-dance. A young lady
should never engross a gentleman's attention
so conspicuously."</p>

<p>"Tom Pynsent amused me extremely,
mamma: he was telling college stories, and
off we capered without caring who remarked
us."</p>

<p>"You are remarkably vulgar and underbred,
my dear," resumed her mother, "and I
have no hopes of your establishment. I am
very much surprised at Anna Maria's beauty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
failing to elicit an offer; perhaps Julia may
do better when she appears, but my hopes
chiefly rest upon Clara. Her style of beauty
is very magnificent."</p>

<p>Isabel's happy disposition received these
shocks with inimitable good humour. She
listened to daily remarks upon her want of
elegance, and believed in her total exemption
from the gifts which Nature had lavished
upon her elder sister; but her mind scorned
the idea of mourning over a useless grief. She
cared not for extraneous advantages which
could not reach the mind: she never entered
a ball-room without a profusion of dancing
engagements; and if she was liked and followed,
even in the presence of her handsome
sister, what did she care for mere beauty?</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral at last yielded the point,
and allowed Isabel to choose her own mode
of pleasing. Her taste turned with horror
from her "unfortunate Isabel," but she ceased
to look at, or remark upon, her <i>brusquerie</i>.
She told Thompson, "some men took odd
fancies to healthy, fat-looking, smiling girls,
and probably Isabel might please some old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
rich widower or stupid retired bachelor, and
marry at last: she would be a foil to her
sisters, at any rate."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral was right: an odd, "retired
bachelor" did admire Isabel precisely for her
healthy, good-humoured looks; and, in process
of time, he advanced, slowly and cautiously,
to the attack; but his manner concealed the
matter long to all eyes but those of her father.
Lady Wetheral was blind to the very <i>dénouement</i>.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine why that tiresome old
Boscawen comes here every other morning,
Sir John, sitting for hours and saying nothing:
pray don't ask him to stay dinner again&mdash;he
makes me ill."</p>

<p>"He is a great friend of mine, Gertrude:
I like Boscawen."</p>

<p>"I know you like unaccountable people,
love; but he worries <i>me</i> to death, and he will
sit at dinner between Anna Maria and Isabel.
I don't consider Isabel, but he keeps Tom
Pynsent away from Anna Maria, and never
enters into any sort of conversation."</p>

<p>"He thinks more than he says, my dear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hate people who think: thinking makes
every thing worse: luckily, I have quite given
up thinking about Isabel, or her loud laugh
would kill me."</p>

<p>"Boscawen does not object to Isabel's joyous
laugh, Gertrude; he hopes to hear it in
perpetuity."</p>

<p>"I wish he would take her to himself, then,"
replied his lady, gently yawning, and taking
up a novel.</p>

<p>"Boscawen has proposed for Isabel," said
Sir John, seriously.</p>

<p>"How can you talk such nonsense, Sir
John! if the old man proposes to any body,
it will certainly be to Anna Maria. I saw
he admired her exceedingly&mdash;so does every
body: she is very captivating."</p>

<p>"Boscawen has proposed for Isabel, however,"
he returned; "and though he is too
advanced in years for a young girl's speculation,
yet, if she could fancy him, I think she
might be happy. I wish you to speak to your
daughter upon the subject, Gertrude. If she
has the slightest disinclination to Boscawen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
do not mention him a second time: I will not
allow her to be talked into matrimony."</p>

<p>"Then, talk to her yourself, Sir John. I
am quite overpowered by the surprise. I was
so certain Boscawen admired Anna Maria;
but since he has the bad taste to prefer Isabel,
she ought not to demur an instant. Boscawen
is very rich, and I dare say he will act
very handsomely as to settlements. When
old men marry young wives, they ought to pay
for the distinction. Isabel will be very foolish
if she declines him."</p>

<p>Anna Maria at this moment appeared at
the door, and Lady Wetheral's ideas excursed
at the sight of her beautiful daughter, still so
admired, yet unsought.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, I am glad you are come
at this moment; here is Mr. Boscawen proposing
for Isabel, and no one asks for you: I
can't understand it. Perhaps, my love, if <i>you</i>
chatted a <i>little</i> more&mdash;but you must 'take' in
time. Old Boscawen is no great things, only
he is so rich; there is no saying when Isabel
may be a gay widow."</p>

<p>"Does my sister accept Mr. Boscawen?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
asked Anna Maria, in dulcet tones, without
replying to her mother's hints.</p>

<p>"She will do so, if she has common sense;
but we have sent for her. Your father is to
talk to her."</p>

<p>Isabel obeyed the summons, which prayed
for her appearance in Lady Wetheral's <i>boudoir</i>.
She entered laughing.</p>

<p>"I am sure I know the reason of your summons,
papa. Mr. Boscawen has written to
you."</p>

<p>"And you will not be so mad as to refuse
such an excellent establishment," cried her
mother, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Stay, Gertrude; I will not allow Isabel
to be influenced."</p>

<p>"He can make any settlement you please,
Isabel," continued her mother.</p>

<p>"Gertrude&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is old and ugly, Isabel"&mdash;Lady Wetheral
rose unconsciously from the sofa in her
energy, perfectly deaf to her husband's call
to order&mdash;"he is old and ugly; but no girl
in her senses would refuse such an establishment.
You cannot stake a handsome face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
against a fortune, which will purchase all a
woman prizes most. You will be respectable
and enviable, for you will command every
thing that is covetable in this world!"</p>

<p>Sir John was distressed and indignant at
the sentiment conveyed in his lady's discourse;
but he knew it was vain to contend with a
mind anchored upon the world. He turned
to Isabel.</p>

<p>"I wish to know, my love, if Mr. Boscawen's
offer is disagreeable to you. If you
reject his suit, <i>I</i> will take care he shall not
offend again."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral fixed her eyes with intense
anxiety upon Isabel, who promptly replied
the offer had been made with her knowledge
and concurrence.</p>

<p>"My dear Isabel, I thought you would not
overlook such advantages," cried her ladyship,
embracing her daughter with unfeigned
delight.</p>

<p>"Isabel," said her father, "you wish to
marry Mr. Boscawen?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, papa, I do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"You wish to quit your home, my love,
and live altogether with Mr. Boscawen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I do, papa."</p>

<p>"Are you aware, Isabel, that in marrying
Mr. Boscawen you must become steady and
obedient, and submit to his wishes and
views?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, papa."</p>

<p>"Are you aware, my love, that when you
have become a wife, you must quit home for
ever, and remain with Mr. Boscawen at
Brierly, to nurse him in sickness, and console
him in sorrow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, papa, I know all that perfectly;
and I shall like very much to nurse Mr. Boscawen,
he is so good-tempered."</p>

<p>"Yet, listen to me, Isabel, I have much to
say," and her father's countenance and manner
became impressively serious. "You are
too young to understand the solemn vows
you must make at the altar. I know Boscawen
is a good man, or I should not have
listened to his offer when he proposed for a
girl young enough to be his daughter. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
must have given him great encouragement,
Isabel."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, papa, I <i>did</i>. I told him I would
be sure to be his wife, if you had no objection,
and I hope you do not mean to prevent
it."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral became indignant at her
husband's serious view of matrimony, and she
had recourse to her vinaigrette, as usual, upon
exciting subjects.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine, Sir John, why you
should endeavour to make doubts for Isabel,
when such an offer may never occur again&mdash;certainly
not to Isabel, who has so little appearance.
It quite provokes me to hear you
raising difficulties about a nonsensical affair
of marriage. Isabel will marry like other
girls, and get on like other people."</p>

<p>"I do not wish my daughter to marry like
other girls, Gertrude. I wish Isabel to be
happy and respected."</p>

<p>"And who will deny her being very happy,
Sir John, when she has every luxury her
mind can invent; and who denies a woman's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
respectability when she is rich and well connected?
Nonsense, my dear."</p>

<p>"We never agree in sentiment, Gertrude,"
said her husband, gravely.</p>

<p>"How can I see things, love, in the
strange light you represent them? My
mother never read <i>me</i> such lectures as you
preach to Isabel, and I was scarcely her age
when I married. I was congratulated on my
good fortune, and you know we both drove
immediately to Hamlet's. Pray let Isabel
enjoy herself."</p>

<p>"Oh pray, papa, let me have Mr. Boscawen,"
cried Isabel, clasping her hands as
the tears burst from her dark, blue eyes.
"Do not say I am not to have Mr. Boscawen!
and he has ordered me a tilbury
cloak upon the certainty of my accepting
him; it is to have a leopard's claw as a
fastening round my throat! Oh papa,
papa!"</p>

<p>"I have not uttered a word about refusing
Mr. Boscawen, my love."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, papa, thank you!" and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Isabel flew to embrace her father. "My
own good papa, not to make me miserable!"</p>

<p>"You would be unhappy, then, if I declined
Mr. Boscawen, Isabel?"</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, wretched!&mdash;the cloak too of
no use, and I had so set my heart upon the
leopard's claw!"</p>

<p>"A small 'forget-me-not' would have been
in better taste, Isabel," observed her mother.</p>

<p>"No, I particularly admire the leopard's
claw, because Mr. Boscawen liked it. And
then, papa, we are to drive in his tilbury, and
I am to have a fur cap with a tassel, and
choose it myself&mdash;I shall be so happy!"</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be said. Isabel
looked upon every thing connected with Mr.
Boscawen <i>en couleur de rose</i>, and her imagination
pictured Brierly as a home of enchantment.
She believed her days were to glide
away among rural sports and in juvenile
assemblies&mdash;the summer would be dedicated
to haymaking and gathering roses&mdash;the
winter would be a continuity of music and
dancing. If her father's remarks chased the
smile from her lips, as he alluded to scenes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of duty and the cares of a family, they were
speedily recalled by Lady Wetheral's enumeration
of the comforts which must attach to
her situation.</p>

<p>"My dear Isabel, your father alarms you;
but, trust me, there is nothing alarming in
matrimony. You will have a large settlement,
and a handsome allowance, therefore
every thing will go smoothly. If you have
a family, it won't much inconvenience you.
Shut out the nurseries with baize doors, and
you will be free from noise. I managed very
well, for sometimes I did not see or hear you
children for weeks."</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen was admitted as an accepted
lover, and Isabel did not regret her acceptance
of a man who listened with admiration
and interest to her remarks, and who never
turned from her <i>brusquerie</i> with the disgust
her mother could not conceal towards her.
Mr. Boscawen at five and forty looked with
delight upon Isabel, whose extreme youth
and beauty threw a halo around her uneducated
mind. Her rich and joyous laugh
pleased the taciturn nature of his mind; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was charmed by her innocence, and untired
by her ceaseless prattle; therefore was Mr.
Boscawen her constant and loved companion,
whom her eye sought in all companies and
at all moments, and to whom her inmost
thoughts were communicated. She loved to
hang upon his arm, and take long walks with
her darling Boscawen; she delighted to drive
his tilbury, and exhibit the cloak of long
promise&mdash;to chat freely, and, as she expressed
it in confidence to Julia, to rattle away about
nothing, and be just as much admired, as
though she spoke sense, like Anna Maria.</p>

<p>Isabel's wedding-day was to herself a day
of extravagant enjoyment and agreeable confusion.
She was going to a home of her own&mdash;to
be called in future "Mrs. Boscawen," and
to receive the compliments of the bridal-party.
There was a large company to breakfast, and
the Spottiswoodes were of the chosen number
who had the pleasure of congratulating Isabel
upon her magnificent prospects. Isabel
thanked Miss Spottiswoode for her friendly
wishes.</p>

<p>"Now, I am married, dear Sophy, I wish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
you were all going to do the same thing. I
should so have liked four or five weddings at
once! but you will all come and see me, and
we will have such merriment; won't we, Mr.
Boscawen?"</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen bowed smilingly to Isabel's
appeal, and she proceeded&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will drive you all in the tilbury, when
you come to Brierly; it holds only Mr. Boscawen
and myself now, but I dare say we can
squeeze four. Mr. Boscawen is very stout,
and his coat covers an acre of ground; doesn't
it, Mr. Boscawen?"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral became visibly uneasy at
Isabel's loquacity, and endeavoured to change
the subject; but Mrs. Boscawen was too
happy and too unsuspecting to observe a hint,
or detect a look; her heart was full of hope,
and revelling in novel situations. She talked
on, inviting every body to Brierly, and appealing
to Mr. Boscawen if he would not be
delighted to have his house as full as it could
hold. The bridal carriage drawing to the
door relieved Lady Wetheral's distress.</p>

<p>At the parting moment, Isabel preserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
her serenity, while her sisters wept over the
kind-hearted companion they were now to
lose. Isabel's gentleness of temper, her
buoyant spirits, and warm affections, endeared
her to all her family-circle, and they doubly
valued her excellence when her society was
on the eve of being withdrawn for ever.
Isabel smiled as radiantly as usual under the
repeated embraces of her weeping sisters, and
cheered their grief.</p>

<p>"My dear girls, you see I am married, and,
as mamma says, I can do what I like, I mean
to have each of you with me in turn, so pray
do not cry. Julia, you will come first, and
we will have such fun, haymaking! shan't we,
Mr. Boscawen? And Clara, when <i>you</i> come
to me, we will gallop over the country on
ponies; won't we, Mr. Boscawen?"</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen kissed Isabel's hand without
reply, and her father led her to her carriage.
The new equipage struck her eye.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma! how you will delight in my
carriage! It's quite my own; is it not, Mr.
Boscawen? When you come to Brierly, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
will drive about all day. You know you said
it would be the best part of the show."</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen had never approved Lady
Wetheral's sentiments, and rarely entered
into conversation with her. Isabel's observation
had its effect; he bowed very coolly to
her ladyship, and ordered the postillions to
drive on. The carriage was soon lost in the
distance. Lady Wetheral was disconcerted at
Isabel's unfortunate speech, and she remarked
upon it in passing from the colonnade into the
breakfast-room.</p>

<p>"Isabel has married much better than I
anticipated; but nothing will heal her dreadful
propensity to make remarks in the wrong
place, and repeat observations improperly.
This unladylike want of caution will ruin her
reputation as a woman of fashion, but she is
no longer 'Miss Wetheral.' Isabel is now
Mrs Boscawen."</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>Julia was now advanced in consequence of
Mrs. Boscawen's marriage, and she stepped
from Thompson's room into society, as Minerva
sprung from the brain of Jupiter, fully
armed and equipped for her vocation. Lady
Wetheral was greatly pleased with the <i>air
de société</i> which Julia displayed in her intercourse
with the new world, her playful badinage
with gentlemen, and her intuitive knowledge
of the "proprieties." Her mother
hailed her as a star of promise.</p>

<p>"My dear Sir John, Julia puts me very
much in mind of myself, at her age: do you
observe the nicety with which she glides
through her ceremonies? She is much more
brilliant than Anna Maria, and never incautious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
like poor Isabel. I shall look very high
for Julia."</p>

<p>"Who is to be the doomed man, Gertrude?"
asked Sir John, quietly.</p>

<p>"I know you laugh at me, but I don't
consider you a proper judge of daughters'
educations. You would let them marry any
thing, if a stupid curate or poor lieutenant
could persuade you they had good hearts!"</p>

<p>"My daughters' hopes of happiness must
depend upon their companion having a heart
and principles."</p>

<p>"A fiddlestick, Sir John! Does a good
heart buy a carriage and four, or can principle
purchase comforts? What would Boscawen's
heart be without his income? but
you have such an odd way of talking. I
don't say that a good heart is not very well
in its way, but I do insist upon it, money is
the first object."</p>

<p>"Such sentiments, Gertrude, are very unfit
from a parent's lips. I trust your daughters
may marry early in life, to be withdrawn
from your influence."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral burst into tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is always your cruel way, Sir John,
when I am speaking confidentially to you
about my children's prospects. I am sure
they hear from me the very best sentiments:
I have always entreated them to do nothing
improper&mdash;I have always told them to avoid
publicity, and never lose their place in society.
If any of my daughters went wrong, I would
never see them again."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'going wrong,'
Gertrude?"</p>

<p>"Why I mean losing their reputation by a
conspicuous flirtation with a married man, or
running away from the man they marry, or
doing any thing which loses a woman her high
position in public opinion:&mdash;any dereliction of
that kind I never&mdash;<i>never</i> would pardon, and my
girls know it. You always do me injustice,
Sir John."</p>

<p>Sir John could not behold his lady's tears
unmoved; it was his weak point, and his lady
was aware of her power. In this instance she
triumphed over his weakness, and won an easy
victory, for she silenced the grave rebukes
which affected her self-love. A kiss of affection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
on his part dissipated every woeful
feeling on the face of her ladyship: its very
remembrance was past away.</p>

<p>"Well now, my love, since you are sorry you
offended me, I have a great deal to say. I
want you particularly to ask Lord Ennismore
to Wetheral. Don't look grave, my dear Sir
John; the poor fellow is dragging on an odd
kind of existence, but still he lives. Just ask
him to spend his Christmas with us, and of
course his mother must be included in the invitation.
I do not coerce young gentlemen,
therefore you cannot have fears for their
safety. Ask that poor unhealthy creature,
at any rate; his lordship has the option of declining
an invitation which does not give him
satisfaction."</p>

<p>Sir John submitted to the "arrangement,"
and, most unexpectedly to himself, Lord Ennismore
accepted the invitation. Lady Wetheral
could not conceal her raptures; Julia also was
pleased, and after a long <i>tête-à-tête</i> with her
mother, she reported the conference to Anna
Maria.</p>

<p>"I have had a long lecture from mamma,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
but that is nothing new. She has been
anxiously beseeching me to captivate poor
measly Ennismore, which I had long decided
to do before papa issued his invitation, only I
amused myself with assuring her I could not
endure such a wretched sickly creature. Poor
mamma had recourse to all her essence bottles,
perfectly fatigued with setting forth his lordship's
titles and rent-roll. She says all her
hopes are anchored upon myself, as she is
sure you will never marry now."</p>

<p>"Does she?" replied Anna Maria, softly
and tranquilly.</p>

<p>"Yes, she told me you had passed two
years without an offer, and therefore you
must be considered <i>passé</i>, as Tom Pynsent
did not come forward."</p>

<p>A deep blush overspread the cold pale cheek
of Anna Maria, but she made no reply.</p>

<p>"Mamma told me if Lord Ennismore did
not attach himself to me, I could but try
Tom Pynsent, as she very much wished one
of us to be established at Hatton; but though
I may flirt with Tom Pynsent, I would not
marry such a hunting, loud-voiced man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Anna Maria remained silent; Julia proceeded.</p>

<p>"You will not make a reply, and how can
I go on talking without an audience? Mamma
takes great pains to plan our attacks, but she
deserts us in our hour of need. I am sure she
held up Tom Pynsent to you as the one thing
needful, and because you did not take to each
other, she is quite certain you will remain
single."</p>

<p>Anna Maria's lips were compressed, and no
sound issued from their portals. Julia looked
earnestly in her face, and beheld tears flowing:
she threw her arms round her sister's graceful
neck and embraced her.</p>

<p>"My dear Anna Maria, tell me why you
weep, and why you take mamma's nonsense
to heart? Every body loves you, dear Anna,
and you will marry in time, though Isabel did
go before you."</p>

<p>Anna Maria's heart was too full to give
utterance in words, but a violent fit of weeping
relieved her, and Julia's embraces won
her confidence. She unburthened her sorrow
to this affectionate sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not regret Isabel's marriage, Julia,
or my own singlehood, so lamented by my
mother:&mdash;it is not that I deplore; but I was
taught to&mdash;I was assured&mdash;" another long fit
of weeping succeeded, and again Julia soothed
the choking violence of her sister's grief. An
interval of calm allowed poor Anna Maria to
proceed.</p>

<p>"If I had not been taught to consider Tom
Pynsent as an assured lover&mdash;if my mother
had not persevered in holding him up to my
view as a model of perfection, and woven
his idea into my very nature, I should not
have loved so fondly the man you despise,
Julia."</p>

<p>Julia gazed at her sister in mute astonishment,
as she grew energetic in her subject.</p>

<p>"If I had foolishly sought his society, I
might have merited the pain I have endured;
but, Julia, my mother raved about him:&mdash;his
affections were considered the only proper
aim of female ambition&mdash;he was courted by
her, and he was always near me. My mother
sought his fortune, but I attached myself to
his person, and I am cast aside by both. Pynsent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
I know, believes me ambitious and sordid,
and my mother considers me no longer a safe
speculation. I have been the victim of her
heedless calculations!"</p>

<p>"My dear, dear sister!" exclaimed Julia,
bursting into tears.</p>

<p>"Who can repay me for all my useless
suffering?" continued Anna Maria, in still
more energetic tones, her eyes flashing fire.
"Who will return me the peace of mind I
have lost&mdash;the tranquillity of my early days&mdash;the
first happy hours of my gaiety? Who
had a right to betray my heart, and trample
upon my hopes, when I was too young and
ignorant of harm to discover the snare? What
has my mother done for me? I was her eldest
born, her hope, and companion, and what has
she done for me but cast me into misery, and
made my life a burthen!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor dear sister!" cried Julia, in
deep distress; "and under your quiet manner,
you really loved Tom Pynsent?"</p>

<p>"I loved him truly and for ever," replied
Anna Maria, the fire of her dark eyes sinking
into humidity, as the current of her thoughts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
dwelt alone upon the man she adored. "I
can see no faults in the creature you deprecate&mdash;he
may be the character you describe, but
to me he is sacred: I love him, and though
he shall never know it, I will die for him."</p>

<p>"Never more will I flirt with Tom Pynsent,
oh, never, never!" exclaimed Julia,
throwing her arms again round Anna Maria's
waist. "If I had known you cared for him,
I would not have chatted as I did last night
with Tom. Oh, Anna, how you must have
suffered, yet how calm you appeared!"</p>

<p>"I care not who engrosses his attention,"
replied her sister, as the colour rose and subsided
in her cheeks. "I care not who loves
him, or is loved by him: I am jealous of no
one: I love in hopelessness and misery, and
he shall never know my agony. Take care,
Julia, how you trifle with Lord Ennismore;
these hateful flirtations destroy each other's
repose; how selfish, how cruel!" Anna
Maria shuddered as she spoke.</p>

<p>"I will not try to attach Lord Ennismore,"
cried Julia, in earnest accents: "your distress
has cured me of all intentions; but speak to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
papa, Anna Maria, and he will keep Tom
Pynsent from the house. You know how
kind he always is."</p>

<p>"Not for worlds!" cried Anna Maria,
starting up, "not for worlds, Julia! let no
one know I am wretched&mdash;let no one pity
me, or dare to comfort me but yourself&mdash;promise,
promise me, on your honour."</p>

<p>She took Julia's clasped hands in her own,
and, with an impetuosity belonging to her irritable
nature, she exacted a solemn vow of silence.
Julia gave her assurances with regret,
but the vow passed her lips, and from her the
secret never transpired. She was the soul of
honour in those matters.</p>

<p>After this confidential disclosure on the
part of her eldest sister, Julia repulsed every
attention offered by Tom Pynsent, and firmly
resisted his efforts to attract her notice.
Young Pynsent was astonished by a style of
manner so suddenly adopted, and so perseveringly
kept up towards himself, and at first
he resented the cold indifference by an equal
display of composed carelessness; but its pertinacity
at length piqued his vanity, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the end produced a watchfulness which engrossed
his whole soul.</p>

<p>Had Julia flirted on with Tom Pynsent,
his heart would have been untouched; and his
mind, perfectly aware of Lady Wetheral's
schemes, had remained free to sport amid the
beauty which surrounded him. But Julia's
manners, so unaffected, so perfectly guileless,
showed such unequivocal avoidance of his society,
that vanity took the alarm, and conducted
her victim to the very snare he had so
long observed and ridiculed. To be disliked
by a Wetheral, when all the Shropshire world
knew he had long been a favourite speculation
of her ladyship&mdash;it was not to be endured, and,
<i>coûte que coûte</i>, Tom Pynsent vowed to subdue
the cold heart of Julia Wetheral.</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent was not an Apollo, nor did
he possess the fascination of more courtly men,
to make the subjugation of a lady's heart the
amusement of a leisure hour. Tom Pynsent
was good-looking, tall, broad set, and loud in
speech, as Julia had described him: he was
also empty, good-natured, and immoderately
fond of fox-hunting. His very large fortune
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
in perspective gave him the <i>entrée</i> of the
neighbourhood at all hours, and if Tom Pynsent
failed in the soft elegance of speech, or
appeared to some disadvantage in the ball-room
among his more polished companions,
yet upon his attentions were the eyes of
woman taught to rest; and many a glance of
admiration was bestowed upon the uncouth,
ill-dressed Tom Pynsent, which other more
gifted swains failed to obtain.</p>

<p>It was the fate of Anna Maria to love this
man; and while the cold, stiff manners of the
beautiful Miss Wetheral, chilled the approach
of distant admirers, her heart was sincerely
and really given to Tom Pynsent. It is in
vain to argue upon love, which arises from a
thousand causes unconnected with personal
appearance. Love takes a thousand forms,
and defies the power of reason. When
Shakespeare gave the "Weaver" charms in
the eyes of Titania, he illustrated at once its
blindness and its intensity. Tom Pynsent
might have sought and won the heart and
taste of Miss Wycherly, who regularly attended
the hunt and broke in her own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
carriage horses, but who could suppose he
had power to captivate the gentle and graceful
Miss Wetheral?</p>

<p>Lady Spottiswoode was celebrated for the
agreeability and number of her carpet dances.
Every fortnight produced a gay society at her
large mansion in Shrewsbury; and at her
parties the county families mixed occasionally
with the more humble inhabitants of the town.
It was this very mixture which gave Lady
Spottiswoode's parties their decided superiority
over those of the neighbourhood; for at
her house she possessed the advantage of numbers,
and she congregated more youth, beauty,
and novelty than her country neighbours could
ever boast at their <i>élite</i>, but smaller, and less
pleasant meetings.</p>

<p>Shrewsbury, at the time of Miss Wetheral's
introduction, contained many families whose
claims to gentility might compete with their
own, but whose income excluded them from
distant and expensive society. They were always
assembled at Lady Spottiswoode's, and,
from the variety and novelty which sparkled
in her drawing-rooms, her parties were considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the most delightful reunions in the
country. No one ever stayed away from Lady
Spottiswoode's, who had the power of locomotion;
and it was at Lady Spottiswoode's assemblies
that Tom Pynsent carried on his plans
for lowering the pride of Julia Wetheral.</p>

<p>Anna Maria beheld in the keenest pain,
but with unaltered expression of countenance,
his unceasing persecution of her sister: whichever
way Julia moved, Tom Pynsent was beside
her, or before her; his eyes were, eternally
watching her actions, and, when Julia
was not his partner, he declined joining the
dancers. If Julia observed his fixed determination
to be attentive, she heeded it not,
for she was dancing and flirting with Lord
Ennismore, and her heart disdained the
man who had deserted her sister, after a
long course of ungenerous flirtation, which
meant nothing, and which had injured the
peace of its object.</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent's character was, however,
open, and above-board: he had firmly believed
Anna Maria a party in her mother's schemes,
and his attentions eliciting no marked return,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
it persuaded him her heart was safe, though
her ambition might grasp at becoming mistress
of Hatton; Julia would have become
the equally indifferent object of an unmeaning
flirtation, had not her sister's unexpected confidence
seared her feelings towards him. But
Tom Pynsent, the long-contested Tom Pynsent,
the idol of Lady Wetheral's hopes, was
now seriously in love with the lively, fascinating
Julia, and Love could not teach his nature
to dissemble a feeling which once took
possession of his heart. He was found out,
and quizzed most unmercifully by his companions,
but Tom Pynsent had always a "rowland"
for their "oliver." Young Charles Spottiswoode
attacked him at his mother's party.</p>

<p>"Why, Pynsent, people say you have no
eyes for any girl but Julia Wetheral, and you
do look dreadfully cut up when she dances
with Ennismore, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I dare say I do," replied Pynsent, in his
usual loud tone of voice, "and, if I look cut
up, you may depend upon it I am so."</p>

<p>"Then you are fairly in for it, Pynsent,"
laughed his companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I am, but I suppose I have no
chance with that d&mdash;d pinched-in waisted
lord."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent's sentiments were given <i>pro
bono publico</i>, and a group of gentlemen quickly
gathered round him, some laughing at his
situation, others sympathizing with him. Tom
Pynsent never lowered his voice.</p>

<p>"I dare say you are all quizzing me, but I
don't care for that. I know I am in love
with a devilish fine girl, so I'm not a bit
ashamed, and, if that fellow with his mincing
steps gets her, I can't help myself, but I'll be
hanged if I hunt till I have asked her!"</p>

<p>"We thought you liked the eldest sister,
Pynsent?" said Mr. Wycherly.</p>

<p>"Did you? I didn't, though. I like Julia
Wetheral, and I don't care who knows it.
Laugh away, boys, and hunt by yourselves,
till I come among you again."</p>

<p>So saying, Tom Pynsent coolly withdrew
from the group, and stationed himself opposite
to Julia, who was still dancing with Lord
Ennismore.</p>

<p>Anna Maria's ear had drunk in the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
conversation, which took place near her and
her mother, though both were concealed from
observation. Lady Wetheral listened, with
joy of the deepest and most powerful nature,
to the confession of Tom Pynsent's affection
for Julia, and the restraints of society scarcely
concealed the exhibition of its effects. Anna
Maria preserved her calm demeanour, and
bore with intrepidity the acknowledgment of
his love for another. A common observer
would have pitied the cold indifferent character
of Miss Wetheral's countenance; none knew
the pangs which were silently devouring her
existence. She bore the outpourings of her
mother's self-congratulation with unflinching
steadiness.</p>

<p>"My dear Anna Maria, I have now married
two daughters admirably, for Julia will
assuredly marry Tom Pynsent very shortly.
Did you not hear him say he should ask her
before he hunted? Most likely this very
night. What will your father say now? I
wish he had been here! but I am sure it is
time to return home. Where is my dear
Julia! oh, Lord Ennismore is dancing with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
her, I see; Lord Ennismore will do for Clara,
whom I shall bring out immediately. Julia
will be Mrs. Pynsent, of Hatton, and Clara
shall be Lady Ennismore. I have established
my daughters exactly as I could wish. Poor
Isabel did very well for old Boscawen, because
she was rather vulgar. Well, my love,
just tell Julia we must order the carriage."</p>

<p>Anna Maria obeyed her mother's request,
and rose to approach Julia, who was at that
moment seated between Tom Pynsent and
Lord Ennismore. Julia's quick eye saw her
advancing, and she left the gentlemen, to bound
forward to meet her sister.</p>

<p>"Julia, the carriage is ordered; are you
cool enough to prepare for your return home?"</p>

<p>The words were calmly and distinctly uttered,
but Julia was struck by the hollow
tones and dull eye of Anna Maria. She took
her hand affectionately.</p>

<p>"My dear sister, you are ill?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Anna Maria, calmly.</p>

<p>"Yes, you look ill. I know your countenance
well, and it looks very disturbed; tell
me what is the matter?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing." Anna Maria trembled as
she stood. Julia became alarmed.</p>

<p>"Take no notice," continued Anna Maria,
"but let us return home. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, now this moment; let us go."</p>

<p>Lord Ennismore and Tom Pynsent advanced,
and each offered an arm to Julia, who
quietly gave her hand to his lordship. Tom
Pynsent followed, but offered no assistance to
her eldest sister, who clung to Julia's disengaged
arm. They joined Lady Wetheral.</p>

<p>"My dear Julia, you are not heated, I hope?
I am sorry to call you away from the dance;
but I believe it is late, and Anna Maria is
fatigued. Sir John sits up for us."</p>

<p>A little change took place among the party,
and a little bustle ensued, preparatory to their
departure. Julia withdrew her arm from
Lord Ennismore for an instant, to adjust her
shawl, and Lady Wetheral took immediate
advantage of the movement. She glided to
Lord Ennismore, and took possession of his
deserted arm.</p>

<p>"Allow me, my dear lord. You must take
care of us, and give us safely back to Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
John, you know, according to promise. Anna
Maria, I bespeak Lord Ennismore's other
arm for you; thank you, my lord, we are
very comfortably arranged. Julia, my love,
Fate gives you to Mr. Pynsent <i>pour le moment</i>.
Now shall we bow to Lady Spottiswoode?"</p>

<p>The little <i>ruse</i> succeeded. Tom Pynsent
walked to the carriage with Julia, and he
opened the subject so near and so interesting
to his heart, boldly and without preamble.</p>

<p>"Miss Julia, I wish to know if you like
Lord Ennismore?"</p>

<p>Julia was taken by surprise, but she knew
the characteristic bluntness of her companion's
manners and speech, and Julia was
rarely disconcerted: she possessed astonishing
coolness of manners for a girl so young and so
recently introduced: her reply was prompt,
and quietly delivered.</p>

<p>"I know no right you possess to ask me
such a question, Mr. Pynsent."</p>

<p>"I have a right, Miss Julia. If I like a
girl, I am at liberty to ask if she is pre-engaged."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Julia laughed, and her laugh led Tom Pynsent
to form a wrong conjecture upon the
state of her feelings towards himself. He
pressed her hand with considerable force,
which Julia resented by withdrawing her
arm.</p>

<p>"Pray don't be angry, my dear Miss Julia,
at a good fox-hunting squeeze: I am not used
to press ladies' hands, but the firmer I shake
a friend's hand, the stronger is my pleasure at
receiving him, and, if my grasp offends you,
set it down to my affection."</p>

<p>Julia made no reply, but she retreated to
her party; Lady Wetheral was impatient at
her return, but Julia's indignation heeded not
the hopes and fears which struggled in her
mother's bosom; she was offended at Tom
Pynsent's misconstruction of her laugh, and
she stationed herself by the side of her sister.
Tom Pynsent stood bewildered. The colour
rose in Lady Wetheral's cheeks with alarm.</p>

<p>"My dear Julia, you have quitted Mr.
Pynsent in a very extraordinary manner; I
am really hurt; Mr. Pynsent! my dear Mr.
Pynsent!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom Pynsent advanced, but his mind was
in a labyrinth of confused astonishment:&mdash;"Bless
my soul, Lady Wetheral, I suppose
I have done something wrong; but the deuce
take me if I know what brought all this
about!"</p>

<p>"Some little misunderstanding, my dear
Mr. Pynsent; little misunderstandings, we
are told, often lead to agreeable and sincere
friendships; dine with us to-morrow, and
make up this little fracas."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent bowed, with a look indicative
of pleased stupidity.</p>

<p>"I shall be very happy; I am in the wrong
box, somehow; but I can't, for the soul of me,
think why Miss Julia ran away from me."</p>

<p>There was a silence of some moments;
Tom Pynsent could not catch Julia's eye to
learn whether its glance was of good or evil,
therefore, he sought consolation in addressing
Anna Maria.</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral, <i>you</i> are not offended;
perhaps <i>you</i> will condescend to accept my
arm?"</p>

<p>Poor Anna Maria mechanically obeyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the request, and Julia again took possession
of her partner. The exchange was made in
silence, and apparently to the great satisfaction
of Lord Ennismore. Tom Pynsent walked
forward with Anna Maria, and made his remark
upon Julia's desertion.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Miss Wetheral, I did
nothing to give your sister offence, except
squeezing her hand, which no lady takes
offence at, particularly when a man is making
love. I love her better than any woman I
know, and I would not do any thing improper
for the world; but a squeeze of the hand, now,
Miss Wetheral, was <i>that</i> a thing to quarrel
about?"</p>

<p>A cold unearthly smile was Anna Maria's
answer to this appeal.</p>

<p>"I shall have it all out to-morrow, however.
I suppose Miss Julia means to have
me, as she laughed when I spoke seriously.
She does not like that fellow Ennismore, does
she, Miss Wetheral?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," answered Anna Maria, in
a voice so low it was scarcely audible.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew! Miss Julia laughed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
when I put the question to herself, which, I
suppose, is encouragement, but I shall see to-morrow.
I shall speak in time, for fear she
should take a fancy to that lanky dog behind
us. But who would suppose any woman so
shy at a squeeze? If I had kissed her, it
might have been another thing! Bless my soul,
what odd things women are!"</p>

<p>There was no time for further remark on
either side; the carriage was ready, and no
pause allowed a continuation of complaint.
Tom Pynsent assisted Julia to ascend the
steps of the barouche, but she would not address
him, or grant him one look to enable
him to discover the real state of her feelings.
Lady Wetheral bent forward as the door was
closing.</p>

<p>"We shall expect you very early to-morrow,
my dear Mr. Pynsent, and pray do not
treat us as common acquaintance: Sir John
was wishing for you yesterday."</p>

<p>"I shall come very early&mdash;perhaps to
luncheon," replied Tom Pynsent, resting his
broad hand on the carriage-door, and fixing
his eyes upon Julia, "I have something particular
to say to Sir John."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! delightful!" cried Lady Wetheral,
bowing and smiling; "this will be something
enlivening to tell Sir John. Something, of
course, about hunting or shooting, the idol of
men's hearts."</p>

<p>"It's not about hunting or shooting this
time, Lady Wetheral."</p>

<p>"Ah! you mean to be mysterious, to raise
our curiosity&mdash;what can it be? We must be
calm, however, and try to wait patiently till
to-morrow, or rather till this afternoon, for I
fancy it is half-past twelve."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent bowed, and the party proceeded
homewards, enclosing four hearts,
labouring under conflicting and powerful feelings.
Lady Wetheral's happy, uncontrollable
emotions were in strange contrast with
Anna Maria's deeply-pained feelings, which
lay concealed under impenetrable silence.
Julia also was silent and sad; her situation
with respect to Tom Pynsent and Lord Ennismore
gave her young heart its first painful
impressions. Lord Ennismore replied to Lady
Wetheral's eager, agitated remarks with an
absence of mind which proved his lordship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
equally occupied with his feelings; and all
this was originated in the well-filled, gay
ball-room, which had long been considered
the cradle of happiness and the grave of care.
So prone is nature to seek suffering under the
mask of pleasure, that all hearts court its
renewal.</p>

<p>Lady Spottiswoode's parties were the scene
of cruel disappointment, and the cause of repeated
disquietude, yet did the young and
fair of that day crowd to her assemblies, and
severe illness alone obliged a reluctant invalid
to remain perdue, when Lady Spottiswoode
issued her cards from the Abbey foregate.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----Oh! that deceit should dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such a gorgeous palace.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Anna Maria had borne her short but destroying
colloquy with Tom Pynsent without
giving way to the pain which wrung her heart;
and, during the drive to Wetheral, she had
restrained the swelling of her soul, and made
a strong effort to subdue the tears which
rushed into her eyes; but when she had
gained the sanctuary of her own apartment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
all restraint was at an end, and Julia bent
over the unfortunate girl as she lay extended
hopelessly and helplessly upon her bed.</p>

<p>"My dear sister, is this horrible grief indeed
given to Tom Pynsent?"</p>

<p>"God knows it is! Julia, but do not ridicule
a sorrow you cannot comprehend. When
I heard him this night declare his love for
you, and when he whispered it to my own
self, then I felt as all women feel who find
their affection is unheeded and unvalued. I
felt, Julia, as keenly as if Tom Pynsent had
been admired and loved by hundreds."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Anna, you will not love a
man who places so little value&mdash;and is so very&mdash;"
Julia hesitated.</p>

<p>"It matters little," replied Anna Maria,
with impetuosity, "who cares for Tom Pynsent,
or who expresses astonishment at my
attachment. Every woman wonders at her
neighbour's choice, and it is sufficient that I
am most unhappy. You, Julia, need not tell
me I am little valued by him; I know and
feel it, but the information does not come
well from your lips, who have gained the
heart I can never cease to covet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tom Pynsent can never be any thing to
me," said Julia.</p>

<p>"And thus it is," continued Anna Maria,
speaking in mournful accents. "We are
doomed to helpless misery from our birth,
and we prey upon each other's peace. Why
did he constantly attend upon me, when his
heart was free? and why did my mother teach
my first thoughts to rest upon a man whose
affections she could not ensure me? I tell
you, it was wrong!&mdash;I tell you, Julia, it was
altogether ungenerous and cruel. I have
been sacrificed to a selfish policy; and on
the very threshold of life my happiness has
been wrecked, to make existence a burthen
for ever!" She clasped her hands tightly
together, and, rising suddenly from her bed,
paced her room with rapid steps, talking apparently
to herself.</p>

<p>"What was to be gained by my misery?
has it soothed my mother's ambition? She
spurns me as the object who has disappointed
her hopes. Has it gained the long-sought
aim of my own anxious love? He told me
himself he loved my sister. Am I to bear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
all this with smiling indifference? Julia,
Julia!" she screamed, "I cannot smile, I will
not smile, and no one shall see me smile
more."</p>

<p>Julia endeavoured to soothe Anna Maria
into calmness, but all efforts were unavailing;
her impetuous nature was roused, and it must
take its own course: resistance could only
increase its fury.</p>

<p>"Leave me to myself, Julia&mdash;leave me.
I shall be calm enough to-morrow, but now
my very heart bursts at the thought of all
that has passed. Do not try to calm me!
I will not be calm. If I grow calm, it will
be from madness, and I shall be maddened by
opposition. I tell you, Julia, to leave me,
and don't let Thompson come into my room.
There, go, in mercy."</p>

<p>Julia became alarmed, but she turned to
withdraw.</p>

<p>"Shake hands, Anna Maria, and wish me
good night."</p>

<p>"I have no heart for any thing," replied
Anna Maria, irritated. "I will not shake
hands, or wish good to any one, for it is all
nonsense; only leave me now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Julia retired in silence, for it was vain to
persevere in calming her sister's irritated feelings.
Anna Maria's nature was composed of
fiery particles; and her very composed, general
manner concealed a heart full of keen
and powerful emotions. It was the intensity
of these emotions which required the greatest
watchfulness in subduing external appearance
of inward suffering: and to the public eye
Anna Maria appeared gentle and calm to insensibility.
Perhaps only Julia was aware of
the real state of her heart; for who could
discover a powerful attachment under such
cold and calm exterior?</p>

<p>Had Lady Wetheral sacrificed her anxiety
for establishment to the domestic happiness
of her family, all this misery had been spared;
neither perhaps had Isabella been given to a
man five-and-thirty years her senior. But at
Wetheral Castle all parental feeling was engrossed
in calculating possibilities and probabilities
of high alliances, on Lady Wetheral's
part; and Sir John had too long sacrificed
his better judgment to his lady's whims, to
recover again the tone of his authority. Since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
then the ties of affection were so loosely
bound together, and youthful hearts were
taught to bend their nobler natures to the
selfish dictates of ambition, what hope was
there of bright and joyous hours, free to sport
in innocence? What hope was there of that
lovely confidence and peace which gilds the first
years of the young, when parental care&mdash;a
mother's care&mdash;guards the heart from sorrow,
and leads it to love all that is good, and to
pray against the evil passions? What hope
is there for natures tutored into worldly sacrifices,
ambitious only of the world's respect?
Alas! none.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>Tom Pynsent was serious when he engaged
to make an early appearance. He arrived
earlier at Wetheral than even Lady Wetheral
could expect him, and her smiles were
proportionably bland and expressive. Tom
Pynsent would have detected and laughed at
the affectionate reception which awaited him,
had his heart been free to seek amusement in
the hopes and fears of Lady Wetheral; but
the scene was changed. The parent, anxious
for a daughter's establishment, was, in Tom
Pynsent's eyes, his prop and stay against the
forthcoming proposal; and Lady Wetheral,
the "well-known man&#339;uvrer," was at this
time only Julia's mother and his kind well-wisher.
In short, Tom Pynsent was caught;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and, like other keen-sighted men of fortune,
he was perfectly upon his guard, when no
danger threatened his heart; but every firm
resolution melted, when his eye was pleased,
and his fancy gratified.</p>

<p>He was now on the eve of proposing to
Julia Wetheral, in spite of his determination
never to bow the knee to a Wetheral, or to
be "hooked" by her ladyship's gracious compliments.
Poor Tom Pynsent! he fell
honourably at the very head of his thousand
determinations never to visit Wetheral Castle
but as an amusement, and never to flirt with
a daughter of that house but as a means
of raising false hopes in the lady mother's
anxious bosom.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Men's faiths are wafer-cakes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lady Wetheral affected to be entirely ignorant
of the cause of Tom Pynsent's early
visit.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pynsent so very early in the field!
it must indeed be a hunting appointment.
Sir John will be delighted;" and she held
out her hand, smiling a million agreeable welcomes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
"Where are my daughters? they
did not expect you so soon, I dare say. Lord
Ennismore has escorted them walking, probably."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent was disappointed at Julia's
absence, but he only looked bewildered.</p>

<p>"I wish to see Sir John as soon as possible,
Lady Wetheral; I came early on purpose to
see him; perhaps I may find him in his study;
shall I proceed there?"</p>

<p>"By all means, my dear Mr. Pynsent, unless
you allow me to summon Sir John to us.
Am I <i>de trop</i>?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, not <i>that</i>," answered Tom Pynsent,
becoming somewhat disordered; "you
will hear it in time, so you may as well be
present, only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me lead the way then, my dear Mr.
Pynsent;" and she proceeded towards the
door of the study. Sir John was seated in
his arm-chair, looking over a package of new
books; and, for a minute or two, he did not
recognize Mr. Pynsent. Lady Wetheral
was shocked.</p>

<p>"Sir John, you do not appear to remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
our friend Mr. Pynsent, who is anxious to
see you. What is the study, my love, which
so engrosses your faculties?"</p>

<p>Sir John rose, and received Tom Pynsent
with his usual quiet politeness.</p>

<p>"I did not immediately recollect you, sir;
I hope your family are well, Mr. Pynsent;
be seated, if you please."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent glanced at the chair which
was advanced towards him, but he remained
standing with a red face and an embarrassed
manner.</p>

<p>"I hope all are well at Hatton," repeated
Sir John, surprised by the silence of his
companion.</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent could only comfortably entertain
one idea at a time, and his present
idea was exclusively the proposal he intended
to make for Julia. The repetition, however,
roused him from his embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Sir John, I'm come here for a very particular
purpose." The plunge was made, and
Tom Pynsent's voice and manner recovered
their serenity. "I have something to say,
Sir John, which I hope will not give offence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
I like Miss Julia very much; indeed I love
and admire her extremely, and I wish to
know if I have your leave to address her?"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral threw looks and smiles at
the speaker, which encouraged and delighted
the lover; but Sir John was taken by
surprise.</p>

<p>"Sir, you are&mdash;I am, I confess, a very
little surprised. You say my daughter
<i>Julia</i>, sir."</p>

<p>"I wish for your consent, Sir John, to
address Miss Julia. I have spoken to her,
and she did not altogether refuse me, as she
laughed very much; but I think it right to
speak to you upon the subject, that all things
may be above-board."</p>

<p>"You are acting honourably and properly,
Mr. Pynsent," returned Sir John, holding
out his hand, which was seized by the warm-hearted
Tom. He continued, "My daughter,
Mr. Pynsent, must decide for herself, but,
if she finds no reason to decline your proposal,
I am quite ready to welcome you as
my son-in-law."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral went greater lengths in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
speech than her husband, for her joy was uncontrollable.</p>

<p>"My dear Tom&mdash;for now I address you
as my future son&mdash;my happiness will be perfect,
should I ever visit you and my dear
Julia at Hatton. It gives me unfeigned
pleasure to think Julia has fixed her affections
upon an object so truly worthy, and so acceptable
to her own family. This is indeed
to me a very happy moment."</p>

<p>"I will do every thing you wish in the
settlement way, Sir John," said the honest-hearted
suitor, his face almost purple with
gratified feelings. "My father says he will
relinquish Hatton to me directly; but I don't
mean the governor to quit his own favourite
place. Let him keep it for life, you
know, for we young ones can move about.
He will allow me to make a very handsome
settlement upon my wife&mdash;any thing you
suggest, Sir John."</p>

<p>Sir John was pleased by the open-hearted
manner and matter, and his heart warmed to
Tom Pynsent.</p>

<p>"Sir, I wish you well with my daughter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and, if you succeed, we shall easily arrange
the necessary form. You have my best
wishes, for I like your sentiments, and your
father, sir, may be proud of your heart. A
good son is a sure promise of an indulgent
husband, and I quite approve of your declining
to allow your father to quit Hatton, Mr.
Pynsent."</p>

<p>"Why, Sir John, there is but a right and
wrong way of doing things&mdash;if a man does
right, he goes on very well; and if he does
wrong, why, he will be damned for it!"</p>

<p>The voices of Julia and Lord Ennismore,
in playful tones, echoing through the hall, at
this moment reached Tom Pynsent's ears.
He became alarmed and nervous.</p>

<p>"I wish it was over, Sir John. I could
wish to see Miss Julia now, and hear my
fate at once. A man gets very awkward and
nervous in this situation, I declare!" and
Tom Pynsent's red face became ashy pale.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral undertook to make his
burthen an easy one. She even ventured to
answer for Julia's affection&mdash;this was going
too far. Julia had never confided her feelings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to her mother upon any subject, and
Lady Wetheral's anxiety to secure Tom
Pynsent led her into the commission of
much injustice. She had sacrificed Anna
Maria's peace by thoughtless man&#339;uvring,
and now she was creating false hopes in the
heart of Tom Pynsent. His situation at this
moment was pitiable, and Sir John at once
decided upon the necessity of an immediate
conference with Julia. Poor Julia obeyed
the summons conveyed through Thompson,
and appeared in the study brilliant in smiles,
and glowing with her recent exercise. She
was not surprised at seeing Tom Pynsent,
though she did not expect him so early.
Julia was never off her guard. No girl in
existence possessed her perfect command of
feelings, and her self-possessed manner which
never deserted her under any circumstance.
She was quite prepared for a scene with Tom
Pynsent and her mother.</p>

<p>"My dear Julia," said her father, taking
her hand, and seating her between Tom Pynsent
and himself, "Mr. Pynsent has been
here some little time, and he has been speaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
on a subject which you alone can dispose
of."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, I will dispose of it in one
word," replied Julia, in her gayest manner.
"What is it about?"</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent took up the matter as appertaining
to himself, exclusively.</p>

<p>"Miss Julia, I have spoken to Sir John
upon the subject of last night."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Pynsent."</p>

<p>"And, Sir John gives his consent, Miss
Julia, if&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"But I do not give mine, Mr. Pynsent."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral sat rooted upon her chair;
the fountain of her speech was dried up. Tom
Pynsent coloured.</p>

<p>"You laughed at my remarks, Miss Julia,
at the time, and that was not discouraging,
I thought."</p>

<p>"There is no sentiment in a laugh, Mr.
Pynsent, but I am sorry you misunderstood
my manner. Excuse me, but I never can
like you in any light but that of a pleasant
acquaintance, and I hope you will not renew
the subject. I laughed at your odd way of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
broaching your subject last night, but I am
sure I could not encourage you, for I left
you, if you remember."</p>

<p>"You were very abrupt with me, Miss
Julia, but I fancied you were only angry because
I squeezed your hand."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent turned scarlet as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Pynsent, don't let us say another
word on the subject, and pray don't worry
me with complaints, for I am speaking my
unchangeable sentiments when I say, any expostulation
on your part will only make me
dislike you; and I really like you very much as
only Tom Pynsent, our pleasant neighbour."</p>

<p>"Why, there's only a right and wrong way
of doing things," replied Tom Pynsent,
rising; "and I have no idea of teazing a
woman as if I was digging out a fox, to make
her dread the sound of my voice. I wish
you well, Miss Julia, and as you will never
hear me complain of a woman who tells me
plump she does not like me, you need not be
afraid of meeting me sometimes. I like
every body to be above-board, and say what
they mean. I am very sorry to appear rude,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Sir John, but you will excuse my taking
leave. I came upon a business which is
settled, you know, so I had better take myself
off."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent bowed, and turned towards
Lady Wetheral, whose lips were white and
compressed.</p>

<p>"I must not take a lady's word for her
daughter in future, but you did all you could
to give me hope, for which I am obliged to
you, Lady Wetheral. Good morning to
you."</p>

<p>He passed Julia in silence, but she held
out her hand.</p>

<p>"Say we are friends, Mr. Pynsent."</p>

<p>This little circumstance apparently overpowered
poor Tom Pynsent, for he made no
reply. He held the offered hand to his lips
for some time, and, relinquishing it gently, he
quitted the room like a man who had suffered
disappointment, but who was prepared to bear
his trial without flinching. Even Julia felt
admiration at her lover's manly exit.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral was some minutes before
she spoke, though her lips had moved without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the power of conveying sounds. She was
stupified at the conversation which had taken
place before her, and Tom Pynsent was gone
without her having the ability of tongue or
hand to detain him! Julia had unequivocally
refused Tom Pynsent, Hatton, and a settlement!
These things were too powerful to
bear. At length she gained her voice, but it
came hollow and slowly from her parched lips.</p>

<p>"Julia!"</p>

<p>"Well, mamma, what have you to say to
me? Do not you think I made a quick affair
of my proposal?"</p>

<p>"Do you know what you have done?" said
her mother, in the same dreadful tone.</p>

<p>"To be sure, mamma, I do. I have refused
great, broad-faced, but honest Tom
Pynsent; but now I have something to tell
<i>you</i>."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral waved her hand.</p>

<p>"Do not speak to me, Julia; and never
let my eyes behold you. I cannot help
being your mother, but you are no longer my
daughter in feeling, and I command you to
remain in your own apartments for ever.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
You have given me the bitterest sorrow a
mother can experience."</p>

<p>Sir John quitted the room.</p>

<p>"You have brought me in sorrow to the
grave, for I shall never outlive this disgrace!"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you will, mamma:  you must live
to dance at my wedding."</p>

<p>"I detest the sound!" she exclaimed&mdash;"your
wedding! You have refused the first
match in the two counties, and you will be
disgraced and dishonoured among the wise,
while I am pitied and despised by all my
friends! Send Thompson to me."</p>

<p>Her ladyship became hysterical, and Julia
became serious.</p>

<p>"I tell you, mamma, you will live to dance
at my wedding, if you could only keep off
those hysterics. Would you have me accept
two men at once? How can I take poor
Tom Pynsent when I am engaged to
another!"</p>

<p>"Engaged to another, without asking my
advice! Send instantly for Thompson: I am
very ill." Her ladyship rang the bell violently.
"You have killed me, and disgraced my reputation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Julia,&mdash;you have trifled with my
kindness and affection&mdash;you have killed your
mother!"</p>

<p>The servant appeared, and Julia summoned
the redoubted Thompson, who hurried to the
scene of action. She beheld her lady in her
usual state of agitation, when any thing disagreeable
occurred. Julia was seated calmly
by her side.</p>

<p>Thompson applied her usual remedies, and
entreated to hear what had distressed her
lady's nerves. Every family affair was confided
to the lady's-maid.</p>

<p>"Your mistress, Thompson, is discomposed
at the idea of my engagement to Lord Ennismore,"
replied Julia. "You know mamma
has fits now, upon every fresh occurrence."</p>

<p>Julia's words fell upon her mother's heart
like the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet south upon a bank of violets,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stealing and giving odour."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She raised her head, and held out her hand
to Julia.</p>

<p>"My dear child, you have given me excessive
pain most uselessly. Thompson, I am
better; you always stifle me with those salts;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
take them away. Your obstinacy in refusing
Mr. Pynsent and Hatton almost broke my
heart. How could I be aware that you had
secured Lord Ennismore, Julia? I never saw
the least attention on his part, and I had
arranged he was to propose hereafter to Clara.
Well, I am much relieved. I really fancied
you engaged to some horrid creature, like
Leslie."</p>

<p>"If you had listened to me, mamma, when
I told you I had something to say, all this
would have been spared."</p>

<p>"My dear, how can people listen when they
are in terror? I saw you parading before me
as the wife of some common creature, and all
my friends laughing at me&mdash;what horrid
visions!&mdash;but now you will be a peeress, with
the glory of having refused the first commoner
in the county! My dear Julia, you have
done extremely well; I am sorry Anna Maria
has effected nothing; but I never saw Lord
Ennismore offer you any attention&mdash;how did
it all come about?"</p>

<p>"You are the only blind person, then,
mamma, for Lord Ennismore has been publicly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
attentive ever since he came to Wetheral.
You must have noticed his manner last
night."</p>

<p>"No, my dear, that was Tom Pynsent."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, mamma, it was Lord Ennismore.
Every body saw his attentions; so
would you, if you had not been running your
head against Tom Pynsent. Lord Ennismore
has written this morning to his mother to
join him. He hopes she will be with us in a
very few days. I told him not to say a word
to papa yet, because I knew he objected to
Lord Ennismore's health, but we shall soon
nurse him into good care."</p>

<p>"To be sure, my love!" responded her
mother, "Lord Ennismore will find himself
a very different person when he is settled into
married life, with a wife to watch over him.
Tom Pynsent is an excellent creature, but, as
you say, he <i>is</i> broad set, and red-faced. Too
much health is worse than too little, in my
opinion; Sir John will see things in a different
light, when he knows of the actual proposal."</p>

<p>"He must be made acquainted with my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
engagement, sooner or later," observed Julia,
musing; "I wish the whole business was
over."</p>

<p>"Let <i>me</i> open the business to your father,
my love, and I shall be surprised if he is not
extremely pleased at your good fortune. We
will say nothing about it to-day, but to-morrow
I will answer for his acquiescence. Lady
Ennismore will find every thing arranged
when she arrives, and I flatter myself you
will be in Staffordshire this day six months,
I shall be very proud of my daughter Ennismore!"</p>

<p>Julia assented to her mother's proposition,
and nothing was made public till the following
morning, when her ladyship found herself
alone with her husband, in his study. Sir
John opened the conversation, by lecturing his
lady upon her sentiments.</p>

<p>"I am called upon, Gertrude, to object to
many things which take place at Wetheral,
but I was particularly hurt at your observations
to Julia yesterday. Had my daughter
been condemned by the laws of her country
for crimes offensive to humanity, you could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
not have expressed yourself in stronger terms
than the reproaches you levelled at Julia for
declining a man who was disagreeable to
her."</p>

<p>"Now, love, that is past and gone. I was
very angry with her, and should continue to
be so, had I not found her refusal of Pynsent
proceeded from an excellent cause, which I
am going to explain. You know it is very
wrong to accept one man, when you are engaged
to another. That is a rule with all
proper people."</p>

<p>"Julia has accepted some gentleman, then,
Gertrude."</p>

<p>"Ah, how differently you and I feel under
such a knowledge! A mother feels so keenly!
I was obliged to send for Thompson, when I
heard Julia plead an engagement. I was
sure it was Leslie, or some such creature, and
I was in hysterics, while you have not even
changed countenance in your suspense. My
love, Julia is engaged to Ennismore, if you do
not object, which I am sure you will not think
of doing. I congratulate you, my dear, on
acquiring a peer for your son-in-law."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Julia refused Pynsent for Ennismore?"</p>

<p>"To be sure she did, most wisely."</p>

<p>"Then," he exclaimed, "she has done that
which she will repent to her dying day; and
you, Gertrude, must be responsible for her
misery."</p>

<p>"Good heavens, how you have thrown
down all my plans, Sir John, and how you
embitter my happy moments! I cannot
imagine why you like to terrify me in this
way!"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral trembled, which was ever a
prelude to hysterics, but her husband's temper
was now tried "to the top of its bent," and
he heeded not the increasing symptoms.</p>

<p>"Lord Ennismore has been duped into
making Julia an offer."</p>

<p>"I meant him for Clara, love, not Julia,"
cried his lady, hoping to ward off his reproach.</p>

<p>"And you have given one of your daughters,
Gertrude, to a creature diseased in body
and mind."</p>

<p>"What does that signify, my love? Julia
will not think of his looks a month after her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
marriage, and she will be a peeress, with an
immense estate."</p>

<p>"You are marrying her to an idiot of
quality."</p>

<p>"Fiddlededee, Sir John, he enters a room
as well as other people. Who makes a fuss
about intellects, if a man of large fortune
proposes to their daughter? I should die
with shame if you advanced such musty notions
before company. Besides, you asked
Lord Ennismore to Wetheral yourself."</p>

<p>"I did so," replied Sir John, "I did so;
but I believed my daughters must be safe in
their affections. I could not suppose Lord
Ennismore would attract a woman's love;
and I will not believe Julia cares for him.
You have tutored her, Gertrude, to barter
her soul for a coronet, and your system has
corrupted her heart and feelings."</p>

<p>He paced the room in unusual agitation of
manner. Lady Wetheral perceived the tide of
her powerful influence over her husband's
mind was fast ebbing, and a <i>coup de main</i> was
the last resource of her inventive genius. She
became indignant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is well, Sir John, my children have
possessed a mother devoted to their interest,
since you have ever been indifferent to their
well-doing. Had I sat supinely in my room,
as you have done in your study, my daughters
had passed the prime of their days in insignificance;
or, if one had changed the scene, it
might have been her happy lot, perhaps, to
move into dirty barracks with young Leslie,
whom you persist in receiving at Wetheral, in
spite of my remonstrances."</p>

<p>"Leslie would not choose a wife from your
group, my love. His idea of matrimonial
comforts does not jump with your own."</p>

<p>"Don't make me ill, Sir John, with any
allusion to that young man; or imagine for a
moment we could 'jump' in any sentiment together.
Had I sat supinely looking on, as
you have done, Isabel would never have married
a wealthy commoner, or Julia become a
peeress, with the glory of refusing Tom Pynsent."</p>

<p>"Julia has done wrong in declining him for
Ennismore; she has given up an honest fellow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
for a poor, ill-nursed, unhealthy creature, with
a mind as weak as his body."</p>

<p>"I never can talk with you, Sir John, upon
this kind of subject, your notions are so extremely
contracted, and you are so blind to
advantages."</p>

<p>"What advantages, Gertrude, in Ennismore?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my love, unspeakable advantages.
He is a man of rank and large fortune, two
very considerable advantages, and, if his health
is not very good, it may improve; and, as to
his mind, he may not be extremely learned&mdash;few
men are, who are not destined for professions.
He may not be particularly good-tempered,
but&mdash;&mdash;," Lady Wetheral became
somewhat confused in her palliatives, by her
husband suddenly stopping short in his perambulation,
and, fixing his eyes upon her,
"every body has something to balance their
virtues."</p>

<p>"What virtues does Ennismore possess,
Gertrude?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know; I wish you would
not annoy me with such out of the way questions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Lord Ennismore shows good taste in
addressing Julia, and I dare say she will improve
many of his foibles. Lady Ennismore
will be here next week, and I hope every
thing will be arranged in a few weeks, for you
could not be so reckless as to withhold your
consent&mdash;could you now, my love!"</p>

<p>"I will see Julia alone," replied Sir John.</p>

<p>"By all means, but do not invent objections
for her, and do not distress her with
your long lectures, my dear love, for my sake.
I see poor Julia is very much attached."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! attached to such a man in a
fortnight's acquaintance&mdash;for shame!"</p>

<p>"Julia is <i>decidedly</i> attached to Ennismore,
Sir John, quite as much attached as a woman
ought to be. I think it highly indelicate in
a young girl to run after a man, and disgust
him with fondness; those things are not done.
She is attached very properly, and I beg you
will not persuade her to the contrary."</p>

<p>"I shall see, Gertrude."</p>

<p>"You never saw in your life, my love; I
never could persuade you to see any thing in
a proper light."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw through Boscawen, Gertrude, when
you were blind."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! who cared to see through old
Boscawen! I never thought about Isabel,
therefore, her admirers could not interest me.
I was sure she would only attract odd people,
and you see I was correct."</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p>Sir John Wetheral's conference with Julia
was of long duration, for he found her prepared
with a hundred arguments, which bore down
every objection: it was Samson stoning the
Philistine, and every blow told upon her antagonist.
It was in vain he urged Julia to pause
ere she committed herself, and became the wife
of a sickly husband.</p>

<p>"My child, consider your own health, and
the health of the unborn: beware of undertaking
the situation of nurse at your age, and subjecting
yourself to the irritable chidings of a man
weighed down with disease, and prostrated in
mind by its effects."</p>

<p>"My dear papa, that is one material reason
for my acceptance; I am very much interested
in poor Lord Ennismore's sufferings, and you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
would not wish me to desert an unfortunate man
because Providence has afflicted him."</p>

<p>"You cannot be aware of its results, Julia."</p>

<p>"Oh! papa, I am perfectly aware of all consequences,
and fully prepared to meet them.
Lord Ennismore is ill&mdash;I will nurse him. He
is irritable, I know, but I will bear with him."</p>

<p>"I will not press his health, Julia, as the most
objectionable point; there are still more powerful
ones. I consider Lord Ennismore's intellect
enfeebled by disease, and his temper affected too
strongly for your happiness."</p>

<p>"I do not consider his intellects below par,
papa: Tom Pynsent is ten times louder, and less
agreeable than Lord Ennismore: there must be
some disagreeables in every body."</p>

<p>"Lord Ennismore's mind is not a gentlemanly
mind, Julia; I have observed his actions and
sentiments. He is exclusively selfish: a selfish
man can never be an agreeable companion for a
young wife."</p>

<p>"Time will improve him in that respect, papa.
I do not see how Lord Ennismore's selfish feelings
can interfere with me; his fortune will
command any wishes he may form; I shall not
oppose them. As to his temper, I shall neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
see nor hear its display; he must be selfish and
violent with his servants."</p>

<p>"And are these the notions you seriously entertain
with respect to matrimony, Julia?"</p>

<p>"My notions, papa, are really serious, and I
know I shall find them serviceable. I have quite
made up my mind to marry Lord Ennismore,
and say now, papa, you do not object. Mamma
says you will not and cannot object to a match
so splendid; now, papa, say yes, and don't fidget
about ill-health and temper."</p>

<p>Julia took her father's hand, and kissed it with
a gaiety altogether astonishing. Sir John smiled
at the action, and involuntarily drew her towards
him. Julia took advantage of the movement.</p>

<p>"That's my dear, good papa, I knew you
meant to give me pleasure: silence is more expressive
than words, and I am Lady Ennismore
in prospect, am I not?"</p>

<p>"I offer you counsel, my dear girl," replied
her father, gently and gravely, "I can do no
more; the world may suppose you high and
happy, but, mark me, Julia, you will be the
veriest wretch on earth if you marry Ennismore,
and, at that moment, my advice will be useless,
and my presence impossible&mdash;a husband commands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
you, and supersedes your father. Listen
to me, Julia: Ennismore is governed by his imperious
and overbearing mother, whose wishes
are masked by apparent mildness and great
fascination of manner."</p>

<p>"A mother's influence must give way to that
of a wife," exclaimed Julia, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Lady Ennismore's influence will give way
to no one, and you must succumb to its power
if you hope for peace. Her stronghold is the
very selfishness she has fostered in her son: all
his intentions, every word and action of his, have
reference to his mother, who has so long ministered
to his besetting sin."</p>

<p>"I flatter myself I shall be able to compete
with my husband's mother," said Julia, in a tone
slightly tinged with contempt. "I should consider
myself strangely altered, if my husband
turned from me, to consult his mother. No,
papa, I have no fear of that insult&mdash;Ennismore
has too much affection for me."</p>

<p>"Ennismore is not capable of affection,
Julia."</p>

<p>"Well, papa, you are saying the most unkind
things possible of Lord Ennismore, and, indeed,
excuse me if I say you are quite wrong in accusing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
him of want of affection." A burst of
tears followed poor Julia's hurried speech.</p>

<p>Sir John again repeated his strong objections
to the match, and endeavoured to point out the
fallacy of attempting to win Lord Ennismore's
confidence&mdash;the confidence of a man whose mind
nearly approached to imbecility, but who was
linked to his mother by the strong force of long
habit; and her control over his actions, fixed by
constant and unceasing attention to his selfish
wants.</p>

<p>In vain he placed before his daughter's mind
the misery she must endure when the veil should
be torn from her eyes, and she woke to the certainty
of being united for life to a man she
despised&mdash;a man inferior to herself in head and
heart, yet possessing neither respect nor affection
for the woman he had married. In vain he
painted her longing for the home she had quitted,
when all its pleasures, its tranquillity, would be
of no avail; when she could never more claim or
enjoy them&mdash;all was in vain! Julia could not,
would not, admit a doubt of her power over
Ennismore's heart, and she disclaimed all observations
relative to the weakness of his capacity.</p>

<p>"It was easy enough," she said, "to fix incapacity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
upon a young man whom Providence had
afflicted with illness, but the proof was insufficient.
She would rather say Providence had
raised her up to watch over Lord Ennismore,
and smooth the rough path he was destined to
tread: certainly every disagreeable remark that
could be devised was brought up in array before
her, yet she could not feel alarmed: she was
prepared to meet the trials which her mamma
told her belonged to matrimony, especially where
poverty presided: poverty would not be the case
in this instance, and she must be allowed to say
she could not resign Lord Ennismore upon what
had been alleged against him. If her papa positively
forbade the match, she would submit, but
nothing short of his decided prohibition would
induce her to renounce a man she liked and
approved.</p>

<p>"I would rather follow you to the grave,
Julia, than see you the wife of Ennismore!" exclaimed
her father.</p>

<p>"The grave, then, papa, will be my portion, if
you are determined to be unkind to poor Lord Ennismore,
whom you invited yourself to Wetheral."</p>

<p>The father was moved: true, his own hand had
penned the invitation, and it availed nothing that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
such a step had been taken against his own better
judgment. He had brought the evil to his own
door, and the consequence was falling upon him
even now. Julia perceived her advantage, and
again, in gentle entreaty, besought his consent
to her marriage. Self-accusation softened her
father's heart, as he viewed Julia pleading for
a destiny his own error had prepared, and she
wrung from his lips a slow and reluctant assent.</p>

<p>"You have forced me, Julia, to say words
which will seal both our misery," he said, as
Julia clung fondly round him, "and you will one
day upbraid me for my weakness."</p>

<p>"Never, dear papa, never! you cannot know
Lord Ennismore as I know him; and, in days to
come, you will smile at the list of grievances you
brought against that poor, suffering, innocent
creature."</p>

<p>"I have done that which I shall repent of for
ever, Julia; but I yet tell you my judgment has
yielded to affection. I warn you to pause ere
you marry a man your father disapproves&mdash;before
you commit your peace of mind into the
hands of a selfish-hearted husband&mdash;before you
quit for ever the home which shelters you! You
have drawn from me an unwilling consent, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
I cannot give pain&mdash;because I have myself
drawn this blank, for I allowed the intimacy;
but, Julia, I have said, and I say again, I do not
like the man."</p>

<p>"You have said every thing, papa, to dissuade
me, and upon me be the misery you suggest, and
which I cannot believe will arise from my marriage
with Lord Ennismore. Think no more of
me, papa, and do not reproach yourself for having
made me happy. A few months will prove
the mistake of your statements, and you will
rejoice in having given me to Ennismore: indeed,
papa, you will!" and Julia stroked his
hand with a smile so bright, and eyes sparkling
with such deep happiness, that her father could
only feel it impossible to check her dream of
hope. Lady Wetheral at that moment opened
the door.</p>

<p>"What an eternity of time you have been
closeted! I fancied something was wrong, and a
mother's feelings are uncontrollable: ah, Julia, I
see all is right by your bright eyes&mdash;I see '<i>trousseau</i>'
written legibly on your forehead, and a
splendid one it will prove, I am sure. Of course,
Lady Ennismore must have family jewels, which
she will present to you. I will resign mine with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
pleasure, that my daughter Ennismore may
appear in great brilliance."</p>

<p>"You have other daughters, Gertrude," said
Sir John, gravely.</p>

<p>"But none, love, that are likely to marry
peers. Anna Maria, I am sure, will not marry
now: she has let every opportunity pass by.
Clara is beautiful, but peers are not plentiful in
our neighbourhood. Perhaps a season at Cheltenham&mdash;.
But where is Lord Ennismore,
Julia? Let me congratulate and receive my
son: I always admired and thought well of dear
Ennismore: indeed, I may consider it quite my
own match, for you know, Julia, I always said
he must be my son-in-law!"</p>

<p>Lord Ennismore was sought by Julia, and
presented in form, to receive each parent's benediction:
it was distinctly uttered by Sir John
Wetheral, and formed a strong contrast to his
lady's melodious and "holyday" terms. As
Lord Ennismore advanced, his attenuated form,
pallid countenance, and lack-lustre grey eyes,
struck Sir John's mind with disgust and regret,
which he could with difficulty repress.</p>

<p>"My lord, I am called upon, by my daughter
Julia, to accept you as a near relation. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
stated my sentiments to her freely; and as she
allows no objections to take effect upon her own
judgment, I have only to wish you happy in
proportion to the kindness and indulgence you
bestow upon your wife."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral saluted his lordship as a man
of many virtues. "My dearest lord, I cannot
but felicitate myself and family upon our new
and very dear accession to its number. If your
health is preserved to us, we shall have no wish
ungratified; and I trust my Julia will long enjoy
the happiness which must arise from this grateful
and flattering connexion."</p>

<p>Lord Ennismore bowed to each, but not one
ray of expression lighted up his heavy countenance,
or ruffled the leaden stillness of his <i>ensemble</i>.
Julia's smiling face lent increased dullness
to her lover's looks as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I am very proud to meet your approbation,
Sir John, and yours, Lady Wetheral; I expect
my mother in a few days, who will arrange
things for me. She wished me very much to
marry, and I am sure Julia will be very happy
in her acquaintance."</p>

<p>"I am sure I shall love her, Ennismore, if it
was only for your sake," said Julia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"She manages every thing for me," replied
his lordship, "and I have nothing to do but
amuse myself; I think she must be here on
Wednesday, and then she will arrange all things
for our marriage. I hope to receive you very
soon at Bedinfield, Sir John, and you, Lady
Wetheral; I shall have great pleasure in showing
the lions there, and my mother will explain
every thing to you."</p>

<p>"Oh! I look forward to that visit with such
anxious pleasure, my dear lord!" replied Lady
Wetheral. "I have heard so much of Bedinfield,
so much of its magnificence, and so much
more of the excellent taste displayed in its internal
comforts! I shall, indeed, pay you and
dear Julia a visit with pleasure, and I am sure
with profit, for the elegances of Bedinfield will
suggest many improvements for Wetheral."</p>

<p>Lord Ennismore bowed repeatedly during
Lady Wetheral's eulogium, and once more, when
the eulogium closed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My mother has done much towards beautifying
the family estate; and I am sure your approbation
will give her gratification, Lady Wetheral;
as also yours, Sir John."</p>

<p>Sir John bent forward, in token of polite notice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
but he remained silent; his lady had
already poured forth a stream of compliment,
sufficient for all the exigencies of the case. Lord
Ennismore turned to Julia, and addressed her in
his best and most prosy manner.</p>

<p>"I have happiness in thinking my mother will
approve my choice; she has long proposed my
marrying, and I am sure she will tell me I have
done right. I will now despatch a letter to say
I am accepted. I should not like the circumstance
to transpire through any other means, and she
will be then enabled to form her own plans for
our future establishment. I am sure she will
think I have done right."</p>

<p>Thus did Julia become engaged to Lord Ennismore,
and thus did she give herself away to a
man perfectly disgusting, had he been unsupported
by station and wealth. Sir John did not
allude to the affair after he had undergone the
painful task of accepting him in the light of a
son; but Lady Wetheral did not affect to conceal
the triumph of her heart; it revelled in her
expression, and lighted up her countenance with
unusual brilliance. Julia must be a peeress&mdash;the
young and lovely Lady Ennismore!&mdash;had
she now a wish ungratified?&mdash;all was absorbed in
Julia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Ennismore's arrival broke through Lady
Wetheral's day-dream, and demanded her attention;
it was necessary for a time to generalize
her feelings and thoughts; to withdraw them
from resting exclusively on Julia, and to be
again the polite and attractive hostess. The
youthful peeress expectant had not attained her
honours, and another personage was yet to be
consulted and won. Lady Wetheral applied
herself to her task with energy and tact.</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore had been many years a
widow, and her person retained a considerable
portion of beauty and youthful appearance. Her
manner was irresistible to those whom she considered
it her interest to attach; to all it was
fascinating; but to the very few who were destined
to be near her, and who became the involuntary
agents of her will, to them Lady
Ennismore's seductive attractions became a spell,
which none could withstand, and from whose
magnetic influence no talisman could free their
spirit. Lord Ennismore's thoughts and sentiments
had their rise in his mother's suggestions,
though he believed his actions to be the offspring
of his own free will; but her ascendency, silent
and wily in its nature, was deeply and immoveably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
fixed in his mind&mdash;a wife might never
hope to share it.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral could not equal her guest in
diplomatic talents, but she followed Lady Ennismore's
lead with excellent tact, and managed
her husband's distaste to her ladyship, with great
skill. The ladies became intimate upon their
first meeting, and were rarely separate during
Lady Ennismore's stay at Wetheral. Julia was
soon bound heart and soul to her future mother-in-law;
her young imagination speedily allowed
every virtue to manners so flattering, and she
believed herself captivated by excellence, and
the irresistible force of kindness as sincere as it
was delightful. Every member at Wetheral,
save its proprietor, adored the amiable and conciliating
Lady Ennismore.</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore held an interesting conversation
with her son, soon after her arrival at the
castle. They were alone, in her ladyship's private
sitting-room.</p>

<p>"My dear Ennismore, do you take your medicines
regularly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I take three pills every night."</p>

<p>"And your powders, my love?"</p>

<p>"Three times a day, just as I do at Bedinfield."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Julia is a sweet girl, Ennismore; I hope
she will not forget your health, or overlook the
necessity of attending to your medicines."</p>

<p>"I am sure she will be very attentive," replied
his lordship, laying down the book of patterns,
which he was copying for Clara.</p>

<p>"I am sure she means it, Ennismore; but a
fine young creature like Julia may forget occasionally,
and it is so necessary your system
should be attended to."</p>

<p>"Julia says she shall seldom leave Bedinfield;
therefore, all things will go on as regularly as
usual."</p>

<p>"My dear Ennismore, Julia must go into
public as your wife; she must be often in society,
and she must receive company; her station in
life requires some sacrifices, but, should you
often be compelled to remain alone, I should be
very anxious about your health. I hate the
venal attentions of servants; they might poison
you."</p>

<p>"But you will be with us?" observed the
young lord, in an anxious tone.</p>

<p>"My dear Ennismore, I would make any sacrifice
to establish your comfort, but I dare say
such a step is unnecessary. Julia is a dear, delightful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
creature, just the very daughter-in-law I
would have selected. I am sure her tenderest
cares will be devoted to your health. If, in her
gay or occupied hours, she should display an
occasional oversight, remember her youth and
beauty, and the difficulties of her situation, Ennismore."</p>

<p>"But who will attend to my medicines, and
myself?" asked his lordship; "I never can be
left alone, you know; who will play cribbage
with me in the evenings, as you have always
done?"</p>

<p>"Leave that to me, my son; time and circumstance
will do much for us. You have chosen
the flower of the Wetherals for your wife. Julia
loves me, and is guided by me in every thing
which relates to yourself; Lady W. is a ladylike
goose, and her eldest daughter resembles
the automaton in stillness and insipidity. Clara
is very handsome, but I see already the germs of
violence in her temper. You have done very
wisely in choosing Julia; between ourselves,
she is easily guided by the person she loves, and
she loves me for your sake, Ennismore."</p>

<p>"I am very glad I have given you satisfaction;
altogether, I am greatly pleased I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
going to be married, since you like Julia, and
wished me to settle. I am sure she is an excellent
person, and will take great care of me, but
I can't think I shall get on well without <i>you</i>,
mother!"</p>

<p>"My dear son, do you really wish to be
plagued with a mother, when a young and handsome
woman becomes your companion? Cannot
you allow for a <i>little</i> present discomfort, till Julia
becomes accustomed to your methods? Your
poor fond mother will be a millstone round your
neck, dear Augustus."</p>

<p>"I can never be happy without you, mother,
to give me all my things in proper time. I have
been so accustomed to have every thing done for
me, and Julia cannot remember every thing at
once, as you do. You will stay with us at Bedinfield?"</p>

<p>"Your affection to me is extremely flattering,
Ennismore, and your mother will never be far
from you; but consider the opinion of the world,
and, believe me, we must conform in some
measure to its expectations. I will retire to my
jointure-house with proper humility; how long
I continue there, will depend upon yourself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"But Julia does not know my ways; who
will give me my pills?"</p>

<p>"Your young wife, Ennismore."</p>

<p>"Mother, I can't marry, unless you will stay
by me, and take care of me, as you have always
done. Julia does not know I take so much medicine;
she knows nothing about illness; I always
expected you would live with me when I
married."</p>

<p>"You will be very happy at Bedinfield, Augustus,
with Julia."</p>

<p>"I know I shall be very ill, mother."</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered her ladyship, as the door
opened, and Julia appeared, fresh and fair as
Venus, when she first presented her bright form
before the admiring gods; the joyous expression
of her face formed a painful contrast with the
leaden torpidity of her lover's dreary countenance.</p>

<p>"I am come to announce another gay meeting
at Lady Spottiswoode's this day week; all
our party must, positively, attend, Lady Spottiswoode
says, for her rooms are to boast particular
attractions. The celebrated Adonis, Mr.
Vyvyan, and the still more celebrated Captain
Jekyl, are borrowed for the occasion. Here
are notes for each, and all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"And who is Mr. Vyvyan, Julia?" asked
Lady Ennismore. "Every body knows, or has
heard of Captain Jekyl, but I am ignorant of the
existence of Mr. Vyvyan; comes he from Cornwall?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, but he is staying with the
Pynsents, and every body is wild about him.
You will obey the summons, dear Lady Ennismore?"</p>

<p>Her ladyship demurred.</p>

<p>"Oh, then, I shall have no pleasure in the
thing at all," exclaimed Julia, "and I am sure
Ennismore will not care about it if you are
absent; therefore, we will remain together at
home."</p>

<p>"Dear flattering girl," said her ladyship,
smiling, and pressing Julia's hand; "am I so
seriously included in your scheme of happiness?
I will not hear of your absence from so much
gaiety: now is the natural and proper period for
enjoyment, Julia, and, since you are silly enough
to prefer an old lady's society, I must and will
with pleasure sacrifice my own wishes. I will
attend you to Lady Spottiswoode's, and witness
your triumphs."</p>

<p>"My greatest triumph will arise in having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
won your consent to accompany us, dearest Lady
Ennismore," replied Julia; and her beaming
eyes proved the sincerity of her feelings. Julia,
artless and affectionate, was incapable of disguise;
and the parentally kind and watchful
attention of her ladyship won the whole soul of
the object to whom it was addressed. Julia
rarely quitted the society of her future mother;
and certainly her attachment amounted to adoration
in its effects; but, little accustomed to
expressions of regard and fondness from her own
parent, and sensibly alive to kindness, no wonder
the charm was felt, and its influence yielded to,
by one so keenly feeling. The attachment of
Lord Ennismore, however coldly manifested,
and the fascinating sweetness of Lady Ennismore's
manners, opened visions of happy futurity
to Julia's mind; and she drank copiously of
the cup of delightful hope presented to her lips.
All was to her a scene of enchantment.</p>

<p>Christobelle was now admitted to range freely
through the apartments once so impervious to her
sisters, till their fourteenth anniversary allowed
them the <i>entrée</i>, in form, to the delights of society.
Upon Julia's engagement to Lord Ennismore,
Clara was inducted into her rights and privileges;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and Christobelle, under cover of her father's
protection, was allowed to glide silently
among the personages filling the present busy
scene. Lady Wetheral was too much occupied
in "arrangements" concerning the forthcoming
marriage to heed her appearance; and if a kind
remark from Lady Ennismore betrayed her presence,
Lady Wetheral observed "it was only
Bell, Sir John's pet, and concern, altogether&mdash;not
hers;" and she was allowed to roam about
unnoticed.</p>

<p>"Bell" remembered, in after years, how Julia
was evermore seated near Lady Ennismore, fixing
her eyes in admiration upon her ladyship's
fine countenance, and listening to her conversation
with eager attention. She remembered
Lord Ennismore employed almost constantly by
Clara in copying music, or drawing patterns for
fancy-work, and Miss Wetheral occupied in
drawing, with pale cheeks and humid eyes. She
remembered distinctly her mother's gratified
look and manner, as she passed from Lady Ennismore
to her dull son, with the proud feeling
that Julia would soon link her name with that
of a baron of the united kingdom. Young as
Christobelle then was, she could observe the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
difference between Julia's happy, beaming eyes,
and the melancholy expression of her eldest
sister's countenance, pale as her own white dress,
till an allusion to Hatton, or the name of Pynsent,
suffused her cheek with a passing blush.
She saw and observed much, which became a
subject of meditation in after life.</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore demanded an audience of
Sir John Wetheral, previous to Lady Spottiswoode's
ball, and the interview took place in his
study, with every appropriate ceremony and
mystery. Lady Ennismore then, in behalf of
her son, offered to arrange the settlements, and
enter upon the little momentous prelude which
usually preceded matrimonial vows. Sir John
expressed his surprise that his lordship should
require an interpreter and agent in a matter concerning
his own affairs. Lady Ennismore was
never wanting to herself.</p>

<p>"My dear Sir John, young people are shy of
entering into affairs which involve much consideration.
Perhaps I have laid the foundation of
indolence in my son's mind by acting according to
his wishes, instead of compelling him to become
his own <i>homme d'affaires</i>; but my son's health
must prove his excuse, and I shall be truly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
happy to resign the reins into Julia's hand in a
very few weeks."</p>

<p>"Your ladyship must have enervated his capacity
for business, since my lord is unequal to
make a settlement upon his wife," observed Sir
John, drily.</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore appeared absorbed in calculation,
as she ran up quickly a sum pencilled
upon a slip of paper, which she held in her hand.
The employment prevented her from comprehending
the purport of the speech, or it allowed
her ladyship a plea for momentary absence of
mind. She turned suddenly from her calculation.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, Ennismore's income allows
him to settle three thousand a year upon his
lady."</p>

<p>Sir John bowed.</p>

<p>"Her jointure will be three thousand pounds,"
continued Lady Ennismore, "and five hundred
pounds yearly pin-money: does that allowance
appear too little, my dear Sir John?"</p>

<p>"It may not be too large an allowance for
Lady Ennismore," he replied; "but it is a large
sum for Julia Wetheral. I trust my daughter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
will manage her affairs with prudence and credit
to herself."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt her excellence in any point,"
said her ladyship, in winning tones. "Julia
will be the pride of the family who are fortunate
enough to receive her."</p>

<p>A father's tender feelings were touched; they
were easily roused on the subject of his wife and
children. He bowed to Lady Ennismore with
more conciliation of manner than he had yet
displayed towards her ladyship.</p>

<p>"I believe my daughter's heart to be excellent,
and I am sure she will act uprightly in every
situation."</p>

<p>"Ennismore and myself justly value our treasure,
Sir John, and I shall retire from Bedinfield
with the happy certainty of leaving my
son in the possession of every earthly comfort.
Young people should live to themselves, and I
hold it good policy, on every account, to retire.
Do you not think with me, Sir John?"</p>

<p>"I agree with your ladyship. I should not
wish to be domesticated with young people upon
their marriage. They are entering upon life as
we have done before them; and the experience
of old people is offensive to the unsuspicious.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
They must win, through suffering, the knowledge
we have acquired: <i>we</i> did so, Lady Ennismore."</p>

<p>"I flatter myself, Sir John, we think alike on
many subjects. I shall retire to tranquillity and
repose in my cottage of gentility, and the young
people will make the walls of Bedinfield ring
with festivity. I trust we may claim your
daughter in a very short time. The settlements
will not be long in my agent's hands, and Ennismore
is so anxious to present his lady in
Staffordshire! May I make interest to salute
my real daughter in a month? I am now
equally anxious to make my own arrangements;
and my first wish must be to secure my son's
comfort, before I allow myself to consider my
own gratifications."</p>

<p>Sir John admitted that suspense was useless
when both parties understood the nature of their
engagements; and the marriage was fixed to
take place as soon as the settlements should be
ready for signature. There was great ceremony
in presenting jewels; and Lady Wetheral was
the head and front of every thing. There was
immense preparation in the wardrobe department,
far exceeding, in extent and expense, the
ample and handsome dresses prepared for Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Boscawen. Her ladyship explained the necessity
of a very distinct line of demarkation in the
wardrobe of the sisters.</p>

<p>"Julia marries a peer, consequently she will
require a certain style of magnificence in her
appearance. Isabel married a man of considerable
wealth, but still the young wife of an elderly commoner
is not of material importance in society.
Isabel must nurse Boscawen, who is scarcely
ever free from ague since he visited Holland,
and these splendid silks would be useless, fading
at Brierly; it would have been worse than folly
to have given a peeress's <i>trousseau</i> to poor Isabel,
but they will both attend your marriage, my
dear Julia. It will be a proud day to us all,
when you become the wife of Ennismore, a
young nobleman possessing peculiar steadiness
of character; and, though slightly delicate, his
mind is elastic, and his love strongly developed
towards you. Independently of his rank and
title, I should prefer Ennismore to the young
men of the present day. The necklace he presented
to you so gallantly are diamonds of the
first water."</p>

<p>"Lady Ennismore presented them to Julia,
mamma," observed Clara, with simplicity.</p>

<p>"Fiddle faddle! they were presented in excellent
taste. Isabel has no jewels, poor girl."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>When the Wetheral party entered the
crowded dancing-room at Lady Spottiswoode's,
they caused considerable sensation. It was now
publicly known that Lord Ennismore was the
accepted lover of Miss Julia Wetheral, and the
young couple were gazed at with untired wonder.
Each countenance was well known to the company:
Miss Julia Wetheral and young Lord
Ennismore had frequented every fashionable
place of rendezvous for the last three months, yet
their engagement evidently procured each personage
extraordinary power of novelty.</p>

<p>Eyes which had scarcely allowed a glance to
the uninviting figure of Lord Ennismore, gazed
now earnestly upon his person, because he came
as the acknowledged lover of the handsome Julia
Wetheral, and every gentleman glanced with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
heightened interest and admiration at Julia,
because she was no longer of their number to
win and to receive their homage. Julia Wetheral
now belonged to Lord Ennismore, and
her brilliant light must soon disappear from
their hemisphere: she was going to throw herself
away, they affirmed, upon a fellow unworthy
of such a prize. Could she really love such a
poor, sickly creature? far better have taken
Tom Pynsent.</p>

<p>Julia was the star of the evening, from the
contending opinions which circulated upon the
subject of her engagement. She was, however,
innocent of the sensation she occasioned. Leaning
on the arm of her affianced, and accompanied
by Lady Ennismore, Julia passed through the
groupes who watched her progress, and gave no
thought to the whispered observations that floated
around her. She was truly happy, truly blessed
in her own bright mental anticipations, and in
the company of those she loved. She heard no
sounds but the heavy enunciation of Ennismore,
and the sprightly musical tones of her ladyship.
She saw no one distinctly, not even Tom Pynsent,
who stood bolt upright before her party,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
with a remarkably red face. He addressed
Miss Wetheral.</p>

<p>"I am getting a disagreeable thing over,
Miss Wetheral. I heard Miss Julia was engaged
to that young sprig after all, and I knew
I must meet her some time or other, so I am
prepared to do it at once."</p>

<p>Julia at that moment caught his eye, and
Tom Pynsent bowed with tolerable command
of manner.</p>

<p>"There, that is over. I wish your sister had
given herself to a better sort of fellow. That
Lord Ennismore, Miss Wetheral, should not
carry such a jewel away from us. She did right
to refuse me, if I did not please her fancy, but
she ought to have chosen a more likely upstanding
fellow than the Staffordshire earl."</p>

<p>Anna Maria smiled complacently at the
sound of Tom Pynsent's voice, but the subject
was distressing. She could not trust herself
to continue it. Tom Pynsent nodded and
smiled to a group at some distance.</p>

<p>"There's Wycherly and Tyndal wishing me
joy. They watched me bow to your sister.
I'll just tell them they are d&mdash;d rascals for
their pains."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom Pynsent walked away to put his threat
in execution, but the congratulations of the
gentlemen overpowered him.</p>

<p>"I say, Pynsent, you bowed like Sir Charles
Grandison."</p>

<p>"Pynsent, that was mortal agony, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Tom's a cold," cried young Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"You are all welcome to laugh, gentlemen,"
said Tom Pynsent, in his invariably good-natured
manner. "Some of you are merry because you
have not been refused by a woman you like,
and half of you rejoice to find the mortification
extended to another besides yourselves."</p>

<p>Mr. Wycherly turned towards Mr. Pynsent.
"My dear fellow, you cause your own vexation
by hunting after a woman who does not
care for you. Most men run after shadows, and
cast away substance. I married Mrs. Wycherly
because she took a fancy to me, and let me see
at once what she wished and expected. Faith,
it saved me a great deal of trouble!"</p>

<p>"But no girl cares for me, unless she longs
for my money," exclaimed Pynsent, feelingly.</p>

<p>"Zounds, man, don't be crestfallen. I know
a fine woman at this moment, and in this room,
who would take you penniless!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom Pynsent looked aghast.</p>

<p>"Every body but yourself has observed the
thing," said young Spottiswoode. "Haven't
they, Tyndal?"</p>

<p>"Where are your eyes, Pynsent?" asked Mr.
Vyvyan. "I detected the lady the moment
you addressed her."</p>

<p>"'Love in her eyes for ever plays,'" sang
Mr. Wycherly. "'It makes her rosy lips his
care.'"</p>

<p>"'And walks the mazes of her hair,'" added
Mr. Vyvyan.</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent gazed on each speaker in silent
amazement: no pencil could pourtray the workings
of his countenance.</p>

<p>"Who would sorrow for the cold-hearted,
when a handsome girl worships the ground one
treads upon?" cried Mr. John Tyndal. "Not
I for one."</p>

<p>"I wish she would give <i>me</i> one of those dovelike
glances she bestows upon the dull-headed
Pynsent," sighed Mr. Henry Tyndal.</p>

<p>"By Jove, gentlemen, I don't consider myself
dull!" at last Tom Pynsent burst forth. "I
know many ladies who would like to live at
Hatton, though they care little enough about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
its master; but I deny your present statement.
Who is the lady you allude to?"</p>

<p>"Go and ask Miss Wetheral to dance, Pynsent,
and she will assist you in solving our
riddle," said Mr. Wycherly, laughing.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! if a woman looked in my
eyes, as I saw a lady consulting yours just now,
Pynsent, I should feel myself called upon to
fall desperately in love," observed his friend
Vyvyan.</p>

<p>"God bless my soul! do you mean that <i>Miss</i>
Wetheral likes me?"</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent uttered the question with an
agitated and hurried tone of voice, which caused
a general laugh among his auditors, but Mr.
Wycherly spoke seriously and looked in earnest.</p>

<p>"You were in love with her sister, Pynsent,
and had no time to observe other women. Every
one else could read in the expression of Miss
Wetheral's manner and countenance her decided
liking for you."</p>

<p>"God bless my soul!" again ejaculated Tom
Pynsent, "I never saw her look me in the face
in my life!"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, you are as green as a girl
in her sixteenth year. Do you fancy a woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
stares at you by way of shewing her true love?
Her downcast looks and melancholy appearance
betray her. She only brightens up when you
address her, and to all other men she is cold as
an iceberg. Such are Miss Wetheral's symptoms,
and such are all delicate-minded women's
manners, when they are not hunting down a
fortune. I know the sex, Pynsent."</p>

<p>"Such a woman is worth a thousand scornful
dames," remarked old Mr. Tyndal.</p>

<p>"Pynsent looks petrified!" exclaimed young
Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"Pynsent at fault, by the Lord Harry!"
laughed his friend Vyvyan.</p>

<p>"Cold scent, Pynsent, after your late run,"
cried Spottiswoode, entertained beyond measure
at poor Tom's <i>égaré</i> looks.</p>

<p>The group of gentlemen rallied unmercifully
their bewildered companion upon his dull reception
of a piece of intelligence which would have
raised any other man from the dead. Tom Pynsent's
temper stood all jibes with unwearied
patience, and when his mind had somewhat recovered
the standard of its usual tone, he rebutted
their attacks in his own loud tone of voice.</p>

<p>"I don't mind any of your jokes; if a woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
likes me seriously, I shall be sure to return it,
and be very much obliged to her. I like Miss
Wetheral very much, but I did not suppose she
cared for me; how could I?"</p>

<p>"Why, you flirted with her abominably,
once," remarked young Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps I did so, but I had no idea she
minded my nonsense."</p>

<p>"Young girls are easily caught, Pynsent, at
first coming out. You certainly trifled with
poor Miss Wetheral," said Mr. Tyndal.</p>

<p>"Did I? then I'll be hanged if I don't marry
her!"</p>

<p>A roar of laughter followed this announcement,
but Tom Pynsent was nothing daunted;
he coolly withdrew from his companions, and
sought Anna Maria, who received him with
placid manners, and suppressed pleasure.</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent was now enlightened on one
material point; and his vanity was touched, by
the knowledge that the beautiful Miss Wetheral,
so remarkable for her loveliness and extraordinary
coldness of manner, did indeed love him in
silence, above all his companions, and independently
of Hatton! She had loved him in spite
of his proposal to her sister! She had borne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the knowledge of her sister's rivalship in patient
gentleness! She was at that moment receiving
him with kind and conciliating manners, though
she knew he had asked another to be his wife!
Tom Pynsent's heart did justice to her suffering
and affection; and he mentally vowed he would
secure a prize so long unvalued, because so
totally misunderstood. From that moment he
attached himself exclusively to Miss Wetheral.</p>

<p>How did the hours glide by that eventful
evening, in the imagination of the two happy
sisters! How triumphant did Lady Wetheral
appear as she glanced at both daughters!</p>

<p>There was Lord Ennismore publicly displaying
his engagement with Julia, and Tom Pynsent
was stationed at the side of Anna Maria,
in deep, and, apparently, agreeable discourse.
Her triumph was commented upon, by the Mesdames
Tyndal and Pynsent.</p>

<p>"Oh, be hanged to her!" cried the latter
lady, "she has got one daughter hooked on
Ennismore, and now she's driving at Tom: only
watch her man&#339;uvres. I knew what she was
at, Mrs. Tyndal, when she made her visit to
Court Herbert some years ago. Miss Wetheral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
was a child, but I smoked the meaning of it.
She was vapouring then, after Tom."</p>

<p>"Lady Wetheral has been very fortunate
with her daughters," replied Mrs. Tyndal. "Mr.
Boscawen was an eligible match, and Lord
Ennismore of course, in the eye of the world, is
of still higher consideration."</p>

<p>"I think, if I had ten portionless daughters, I
would not give one of them to that poor decayed
fellow, and as I always told my son, Tom; 'If
you bring me home a Wetheral, I'll be hanged
if I receive her, and my word is as good as
your own.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyndal was accustomed to her companion's
manly style of expression; so indeed
was every family in the county. Mrs. Pynsent
was tolerated in her youth on account of her
large fortune; she was tolerated in middle-life
as the mistress of Hatton; she was sought in
her old age, as the mother of her son Tom.
Thus Mrs. Pynsent passed through society
without a single accomplishment, or even the
attributes of a female, supported by the powerful
shield of wealth, and feared for the determination
of her sentiments and the coarseness of her
remarks, by all her acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Separated from her masculine propensities,
Mrs. Pynsent was a warm-hearted, well-meaning
person, and many young people could bear witness,
that if Mrs. Pynsent often offended their
ears, or dealt a merciless blow at their vanity,
she had also befriended them in their need, and
in sorrow or sickness, there was none kinder,
or more patient. Why Mrs. Pynsent spoke
so bitterly against a "Wetheral" never could
be divined; probably some early prejudice influenced
her in deprecating the name.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyndal expressed surprise at Mrs. Pynsent's
observation to her son.</p>

<p>"Really, Mrs. Pynsent, I cannot agree with
you in such very determined dislike to the Miss
Wetherals. I think my sons might make a far
worse choice than either lady present."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" replied Mrs. Pynsent, shrugging
her shoulders, "I hope Tom will never
choose an empty doll from Wetheral: my
brother Wycherly hinted to me the other day
Tom had been disappointed of one of them, but
I gave him my thoughts upon the matter: 'Bill,'
I said, 'if any man could prove to me my son
Tom had made an offer to a Wetheral, I'd kick
him down stairs for his pains, and out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Hatton grounds.' My brother Bill never renewed
that subject!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyndal glanced towards Anna Maria,
who was still engaged in conversation with Tom
Pynsent, and a smile passed over her face. Mrs.
Pynsent caught the smile and look.</p>

<p>"Oh, you need not think about Tom in that
quarter!" she observed. "Tom knows I hate
the name."</p>

<p>At that moment Miss Wetheral and her companion
joined the dancers.</p>

<p>"Your son distinguishes Miss Wetheral to-night,"
said her friend, with rather more <i>espièglerie</i>
than their friendship warranted.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it; I don't believe a word of
it." At that instant her eye caught Tom
dancing with all his might, and she beheld his
<i>vis-à-vis</i> exchanging smiles with him: her colour
rose.</p>

<p>"By Jove! he's dancing with her a second
time, and there's that superannuated father of
his, looking on! Wouldn't any one think Mr.
Pynsent was staring at a puppet-show? I'll
take the old gentleman home."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent rose for the purpose of joining
her husband, who was enjoying the apparent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
gaiety of his son. Lady Wetheral joined her at
that most inopportune moment, and began a
subject most offensive to her feelings.</p>

<p>"I am delighted to see your son in such excellent
spirits to-night, my dear Mrs. Pynsent:
it is an infectious disorder which I already feel
stealing upon me. Such joyous spirits generally
take effect upon those around."</p>

<p>"What ails Tom that he should not be gay?"
growled Mrs. Pynsent. "Mothers court him
and daughters flirt with him; what else can he
require in a ball-room?"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral felt piqued.</p>

<p>"The last time I had the pleasure of seeing
your son, he was not so gaily inclined. I am
glad his dejection has passed away."</p>

<p>"When did you see Tom out of spirits?"
abruptly inquired Mrs. Pynsent.</p>

<p>"At Wetheral," replied her ladyship, in a
gentle tone, while her heart longed for farther
questioning.</p>

<p>"Umph! Men require spirits sometimes,
when they are running the gauntlet."</p>

<p>"Mr. Pynsent won my admiration and regard
by his honourable manner of acting," continued
Lady Wetheral, who had now got into deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
water; "he was always a particular favourite of
mine, and I deeply regretted my daughter did
not accept a man so much...."</p>

<p>"Your daughter! who are you talking about?&mdash;what
has my son to do with any of your
daughters?" Mrs. Pynsent was evidently beginning
to chafe, but she had offended by her
allusions to mothers and daughters, and she was
destined to receive punishment from Lady
Wetheral's hands.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have alluded to circumstances
which have not been made known to you, my
dear Mrs. Pynsent, and I beseech you not to
remember what has passed my lips: I was of
course perfectly certain you were no stranger to
certain events at Wetheral, or I would have
withheld this unfortunate communication; I
thought you knew...."</p>

<p>"I know nothing, Lady Wetheral; and what
is more, I have no desire to know any thing:
have the kindness to let me pass."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent passed on, as her ladyship fell
back with polite ease of manner at her wish; but
the iron had entered into her soul. The diamond
aigrette upon her green satin turban paled under
the flashing of her eyes as she proceeded up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
room towards Lady Spottiswoode. Lady Wetheral
confessed afterwards, her triumph at that
moment repaid her for many bitter taunts on
the part of her victim.</p>

<p>Whatever might be the opinion of Mrs. Pynsent
respecting an alliance with "a Wetheral,"
her son was plunging into the scrape with formidable
determination. He had truly admired
Julia; he had been severely disappointed by her
refusal; but then she never cared for him, and
he had applied to her father in doubt and fearful
suspicion that she preferred Ennismore. There
was a lovely and admired creature positively in
love with him&mdash;a girl, too, considered by the men
inaccessible to all approach&mdash;even Vyvyan detected
her attachment, and the Tyndals envied
him; this was irresistible; and Tom Pynsent forgot
every thing, in the flattering, rapturous idea that
he was loved by such a woman. His attention
that night was extremely marked, and Miss
Wetheral, glowing with happy elation of spirits,
listened with deep interest to the half-sentimental,
half-awkward conversation of her partner.
At the conclusion of the dance, which attracted
the attention of Mrs. Tyndal, Tom Pynsent became
more seriously sentimental and red-faced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral, I think a man may love
twice, mayn't he?"</p>

<p>"He may so," replied Anna Maria, "but no
one ever loves with depth of affection a second
time; how can they?"</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent looked at his gloves, and then
upon the ground. "Indeed I don't know."</p>

<p>"The first affection," she continued, with
feeling, "unites all the best feelings in their intensity;
but when they are crushed, those feelings
bloom no more, though they may not be
extinguished."</p>

<p>"Sometimes one's first love is a silly affair,"
remarked Tom, looking inquisitively, yet alarmed,
at his companion.</p>

<p>"They may be silly, and they may be objectionable,
Mr. Pynsent; but they destroy happiness
at the time, and a first sorrow is the
bitterest."</p>

<p>"I think I could love a second time just as
well as I did at first, if I knew a nice girl liked
me, and believed what I told her&mdash;" Tom Pynsent
stopped. A deep sigh from Anna Maria
disordered him, but it animated his courage at
the same time.</p>

<p>"I know many people very happy with their
second loves," said Tom Pynsent, looking shy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Men may love twice, but women never, if
they really feel an attachment for an object,"
answered Miss Wetheral.</p>

<p>"I liked your sister Julia extremely, Miss
Wetheral; but she did not care about me, and a
man cannot always be miserable about a woman
who runs out of his way. I would rather love a
woman who liked me in return, and would not
check me with stern looks. I am sure I should
love my wife very much; and if she objected to
hunting, I would never go out more than four
days in the week, and I am sure she might have
her own way in every thing."</p>

<p>Anna Maria coloured with emotion, and
turned from the eager gaze of her companion;
her timidity gave increased animation to the
speaker, and he proceeded boldly.</p>

<p>"I'm sure any woman need not mind <i>me</i>: I
am rough, but then a wife mustn't mind those
little things, and if I swear, it won't be at <i>her</i>.
A man swears to make himself understood, and
sometimes one swears a little for something to
do; but my wife need not mind those trifles,
need she, Miss Wetheral?"</p>

<p>"That would depend upon circumstances."</p>

<p>"But should <i>you</i>?" asked Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never heard you swear, Mr. Pynsent&mdash;much&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent drew himself up with strong approbation
and pleased vanity. "Shall we dance
again, Miss Wetheral?"</p>

<p>"We have danced together twice this evening,
Mr. Pynsent."</p>

<p>"Well, and what then?"</p>

<p>"People will remark," hesitated Anna Maria;
"no gentleman dances three times with&mdash;that is&mdash;I
really can't tell."</p>

<p>"But if we like to dance together, what is
that to any one?" Tom rose and took her
hand. "If you will not dance with me, I shall
be sure you don't wish it."</p>

<p>Anna Maria rose, though reluctantly.</p>

<p>"It is not my wish to decline dancing, Mr.
Pynsent: I only dislike making myself publicly
remarked for breaking established rules."</p>

<p>"Never mind rules, Miss Wetheral; we will
dance together, in spite of every thing. Who
minds what people say, if we like to dance together!"</p>

<p>Julia and Lord Ennismore passed at the moment
Anna Maria was debating with her partner:
Julia smiled. "My dear Anna Maria, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
young ladies are complaining of you as a monopoliser;
they say you have been keeping Mr.
Pynsent from his usual half dozen partners, and
there is a combination to vote you out of all ball
invitations."</p>

<p>"I cannot allow Miss Wetheral to listen to
such abominable nonsense," said Tom Pynsent,
privately delighted at the idea of being observed;
"she has promised to be guided by me this
evening, so we are going to dance together for
the third time."</p>

<p>"Come and stand by us then in the country
dance." Julia pressed the hand of her sister with
affectionate meaning, which Anna Maria returned,
as they proceeded together to the set which was
then forming. For an instant they were able to
exchange whispers.</p>

<p>"Oh, Julia, my heart is tranquil, I am again
happy!"</p>

<p>"Glad of it, go on, and mind nobody's looks
or remarks." In another instant their partners
claimed them.</p>

<p>"I say, father, just observe cousin Tom,"
said Miss Wycherly, touching her father's arm;
"do look at Tom smiling upon Miss Wetheral,
and looking so red-faced and happy. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
will be a match, after all; I shall congratulate
him."</p>

<p>"Let him alone, Pen, let him alone, and congratulate
him when he asks for it. Girls will
always be poking their noses into matches, and
making mischief. Say nothing to Tom, and
say nothing to your aunt."</p>

<p>"But my aunt will be distracted, father, at
the match."</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh, let your aunt and Tom manage
their own affairs; they can both take their own
parts."</p>

<p>"Gads!" cried Miss Wycherly; "Tom is
just going to dance with Miss Wetheral the
third time, father; the third time, as I am alive,
father! Well, that will do for my aunt if she
sees it."</p>

<p>Mr. Vyvyan came up at that moment to
request the pleasure of dancing with Miss Wycherly.
Miss Wycherly kept her glass to her
eye, and continued observing the party as she
replied, "No, I can't dance with any body now,
I'm looking at Tom." Mr. Vyvyan bowed with
an offended air and withdrew.</p>

<p>"Pen, you were very rude," observed Mr.
Wycherly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you were; devilish rude."</p>

<p>"What did he come worrying me for, when I
was watching Tom. Gads! father, Tom is
saying something to the purpose now. Miss
Wetheral has given him such a look: poor Tom,
it's all over with him! Where in the world is
aunty Pynsent?&mdash;somebody find me aunty&mdash;I
want of all things to see her fire up!"</p>

<p>Sir Charles Spottiswoode begged the honour
of Miss Wycherly's hand for the following
country dance.</p>

<p>"I can't dance with any of you; I am busy
looking for my aunt," replied the lady, seating
herself.</p>

<p>"Let me assist you in your search, Miss
Wycherly;" and Mr. Spottiswoode seated himself
quietly beside her. Miss Wycherly was
amused by the action.</p>

<p>"Charles Spottiswoode, you may call this constancy,
but I can only consider it tiresome: do
go and dance with some lady who has not the
objection I have, to being worried. I hate tiresome
men!"</p>

<p>"I shall not desire to dance with you, but I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
will not quit this place while you remain here,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"Men always fancy perseverance will balance
their demerits," said Miss Wycherly.</p>

<p>"Perseverance will do much," replied Mr.
Spottiswoode, "if a lady values attention. Love
is only proved by persevering constancy and untired
assiduity."</p>

<p>"A very fine sentiment, Mr. Spottiswoode;
but I can meet you in the field of disputation:
I have always heard that 'love' was fearful,
patient, and easily discouraged."</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> love must emanate from the heart of a
poor devil, Miss Wycherly; not such a heart as
you would prize."</p>

<p>"What do you presume to know of my taste,
Mr. Spottiswoode?"</p>

<p>"I know that you would despise a creeping,
frightened lover, as you dislike your horse for
starting upon every application of the whip.
You would prefer a decided admirer who
bore with your flippancy, and feared not your
power. You have such a lover in me, fair Penelope!"</p>

<p>"You are very tiresome and disagreeable,
Mr. Spottiswoode."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"You like me better than you will acknowledge,
Miss Wycherly."</p>

<p>"If that is all you can amuse me with, we
might as well join the dancing," said Miss
Wycherly. "But stay, I cannot; I have just
declined Mr. Vyvyan."</p>

<p>"What is Mr. Vyvyan to you or me? the
set is nearly completed, and we shall be too
late." Mr. Spottiswoode offered his arm to his
fair companion.</p>

<p>"No, I shall not dance to-night," said the
capricious lady, rising and reseating herself.
"My mind is changed."</p>

<p>"So is mine; I am going to flirt a little with
Lady Anna Herbert. Chatting is far more
agreeable than dancing, in a heated room. Lady
Anna has smiled good-naturedly twice. I am
glad you had the good taste to decline."</p>

<p>"I said I should not dance, but I did not
say I would not talk, Mr. Spottiswoode; how
very anxious you are to take up one's meaning."
Mr. Spottiswoode only bowed to retire. Miss
Wycherly softened the pettishness of her accent.</p>

<p>"Do stay, Mr. Spottiswoode, I have something
particular to ask you; you flurry one with
your rapidity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Spottiswoode sat down. "I am all attention,
Miss Wycherly."</p>

<p>"How can you look so cross at me, and
speak in such dry tones, Charles Spottiswoode!
I hate cross people."</p>

<p>"Then answer me one simple question in
truth and sincerity, or I am gone for ever, Penelope
Wycherly."</p>

<p>"Gads! how you plague one! Well, what
is it?"</p>

<p>"I will know whether you mean to accept me
after all this flippancy. If you do not intend it,
say so; but I demand a reply."</p>

<p>"Then you wish to flirt with Lady Anna,
Mr. Charles, and you think</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'It is good to be off with the old love,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Before you be on with the new.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"You have not answered me," returned Mr.
Spottiswoode, seriously; "answer me, as you
hope yourself to be fairly treated."</p>

<p>"I vow I don't know what I mean; it is very
difficult to make one's choice among such a variety
of Lords of the creation. I have not been
introduced to Mr. Jones yet. I can't say I
admire Tom's friend."</p>

<p>"I am answered, Miss Wycherly; I wish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
you good night." Mr. Spottiswoode turned
from the coquette, and walked up the dancing-room,
without attending to Miss Wycherly's
recall. The lady became alarmed. Was Mr.
Spottiswoode's movement really intentional, or
was he showing her how indifferently he could
take leave, to compel her into acceptance?
There he was positively talking to Lady Anna
Herbert, and looking perfectly composed. Lady
Anna was a notorious flirt, but she should not
entrap Charles Spottiswoode! Miss Wycherly
was not accustomed to be treated with <i>nonchalance</i>;
and that Mr. Spottiswoode, her lover of
long standing, should summon courage enough
to stand upon the defensive against her coquetry,
piqued her to the soul. She sought Julia, who
was dancing with Lord Ennismore.</p>

<p>"Miss Wycherly unattended!" cried Mr.
Henry Tyndal, as he met her on her way to the
dancers, "take my arm."</p>

<p>"Be quiet," said the lady, passing on with
her glass raised to her eye, "do be quiet."</p>

<p>"Miss Wycherly, you are after mischief;
you are darting arrows at some poor wretch
through that missile," continued young Tyndal,
following her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am darting nothing, unless you are my
arrow, in which case I should delight to throw
you to an incredible distance."</p>

<p>"You are witty, Miss Wycherly," returned
young Tyndal, "and whenever you are witty,
you are angry."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly made no reply; she saw and
approached Julia.</p>

<p>"Julia Wetheral, I beseech you to do me a
service."</p>

<p>"I will gladly assist you, if it is in my
power," replied Julia; "what is required of
me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, leave the dance, and listen to me. Lord
Ennismore will follow us, when he perceives you
have quitted the set; here let us be seated, and
I will tell you my anxiety."</p>

<p>Julia smilingly listened to Miss Wycherly's
statement of her little coquetry, and the offended
departure of Mr. Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"And now," she said, "I know you will help
me, and just make my peace with Charles. I
won't give him the triumph of knowing he has
frightened me, but in your playful way you can
discover what Spottiswoode means. He has
positively threatened to flirt with Lady Anna;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and, whether I like him or not, he must not appear
unconcerned with another woman. My
dear, that would kill me. I can't part with
Charles Spottiswoode in that way, you know,
and I just want you to sound him. Now go,
there's a dear creature; leave Lord Ennismore
with me."</p>

<p>Julia undertook the mission, and Lord Ennismore
consigned himself, not to the care of Miss
Wycherly, but to the side of his lady mother.</p>

<p>"My dear son, I have witnessed Julia's flight,
and your consternation," said her ladyship; "you
are fortunate in possessing a foolishly-fond mother
to retire to in these emergencies."</p>

<p>"I am always very glad to come to you, mother,"
replied the poor effeminate young man,
seating himself between her ladyship and Lady
Wetheral.</p>

<p>Julia was some minutes in playful conversation
with Mr. Spottiswoode, and Miss Wycherly
watched her movements with eager attention;
at last Julia approached.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, what does he say? Tell
me at once, is he going to dance with Lady
Anna?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Spottiswoode is very much hurt, Penelope,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and, if you are not cautious, you will lose
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear girl, don't say so. Lose him?
No, I'll be hanged, as my aunt says, if he gets
away from me, to be one of Lady Anna's swains!
I must come down, I see, though it grates me
dreadfully."</p>

<p>"Make haste, as you value Mr. Spottiswoode,"
replied Julia, "or he will be dancing
with Lady Anna. He is looking at us at this
moment; now, Penelope, smile, smile, and
beckon him to you for ever&mdash;don't trifle&mdash;now,
now, Penelope!"</p>

<p>"My dear, the smile would kill me. I can't
smile at Spottiswoode, to show him his power,
and make him impudent. No, I cannot smile
yet, Julia."</p>

<p>"There, Penelope, he has asked Lady Anna
to dance, and they are standing up! You have
lost him by your foolish coquetting, upon my honour!"</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly turned pale, but her feelings
struggled with pride. "Oh, well then, let him
dance away, I care not. It is of little consequence
whether Mr. Spottiswoode prefers Lady
Anna or myself. I shall not condescend to beg
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
pardon for any thing I chose to say to a silly
creature, who cannot command his temper."</p>

<p>"For shame, Penelope! you <i>do</i> care, and you
<i>do</i> mind Mr. Spottiswoode dancing with Lady
Anna; when the dance is ended, tell him you
have done wrong."</p>

<p>"He might have seen by my looks, Julia, I
was not in earnest, or, at least, that I did not
mean him to think so."</p>

<p>"Then tell him so, Penelope."</p>

<p>"Not I, indeed. I never will submit to own
myself wrong to a man before marriage, or after
either, if I can help it. Spottiswoode may rue
the hour he offended me, for never will I condescend
to ask him to return to a woman whom he
chooses to leave for such a person as Lady Anna.
Any other girl I could have borne patiently.
This I will not forgive, for he knew it would vex
me! hang me, <i>à la</i> Pynsent, if I do not repay him
in kind."</p>

<p>"I can be of no further use, Penelope?"</p>

<p>"None, Julia, but I thank you for what you
have done, though it has proved ineffectual. Do
not let me detain you from your party."</p>

<p>Julia endeavoured to appease her companion,
but her lover's careless indifference gave deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
offence to Miss Wycherly, and she persisted in
maintaining an equal appearance of light-hearted
manner, to deceive and distress Mr. Spottiswoode.
She was not long without materials to
assist her design; Mr. Henry Tyndal again applying
to her, Miss Wycherly accepted him as a
partner, and she passed her lover in the country
dance with inimitably affected composure and
gaiety. How did that really attached couple
endeavour to vie with each other in assuming a
coldness foreign to their hearts; and how wretchedly
did they pass the remainder of the evening
in a state of miserable watching and suffering!
Miss Wycherly, in her most laughing dialogue
with Henry Tyndal, cast perturbed and anxious
looks towards Lady Anna Herbert, who was
listening with smiling and marked attention to
Mr. Spottiswoode's compliments. Her heart
felt withered, yet she redoubled her gaiety;
Miss Wycherly was almost noisy in her mirth,
and the sound of her voice disturbed the serenity
of Mr. Spottiswoode, and made him falter in his
own sallies. Lady Anna rebuked him.</p>

<p>"How now, Mr. Spottiswoode! you have said
the same thing three times consecutively. What
am I to understand by this absence of ideas?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have confounded them, Lady Anna."</p>

<p>"I did not flatter myself I had power to confound
your learned mind, Mr. Spottiswoode,"
returned the lady.</p>

<p>"I shall not be the first, nor the last, whom
your ladyship has confounded; all our heads become
turned in your society."</p>

<p>"Very well; I declare I shall tell Miss
Wycherly how you flirt."</p>

<p>"Pray do, Lady Anna; Miss Wycherly is
coming down with Mr. Tyndal."</p>

<p>"Very well; Miss Wycherly, what do you
think Mr. Spottiswoode says?"</p>

<p>"Cross hands and back again, and never mind
what Mr. Spottiswoode says," said Miss Wycherly.
"I am flying down the middle." Away
she went.</p>

<p>"I saw Miss Wycherly did not touch you in
cross hands, Mr. Spottiswoode, but here she
comes again."</p>

<p>The party made their <i>poussette</i> in high glee,
Miss Wycherly appearing wholly engaged in
some joke with Henry Tyndal, and Mr. Spottiswoode
showering compliments upon Lady Anna.
Tom Pynsent and Anna Maria, who stood near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the set, and heard the dialogue, were much
amused.</p>

<p>"Cousin Pen has quarrelled with Spottiswoode,"
he remarked, "and there will be a
pretty battle; hear how he is laying it into
Lady Anna Herbert. I should not like quarrelling,
should you, Miss Wetheral?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, surely not."</p>

<p>"Quarrelling is a rum sort of going on, Miss
Wetheral. I don't think you ever quarrel."</p>

<p>"Never, when I have my own way," replied
Miss Wetheral, smiling.</p>

<p>"I'm sure my wife would have her own way,
if that was all she cared about, Miss Wetheral."</p>

<p>Miss Wetheral was silent.</p>

<p>"I wish I was married to a woman who
would be good-natured, and not given to be
huffed upon all occasions," resumed Tom Pynsent.
"I think a bachelor's life very uncomfortable."</p>

<p>Miss Wetheral trembled violently, but she
loved Tom Pynsent too fondly to be able to assist
his meaning; her heart beat audibly, but
she remained silent.</p>

<p>"You ride on horseback, Miss Wetheral, very
often, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, frequently."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish you would let me ride with you; I
am sure you do not know half the country about
Wetheral. I suppose I may escort you, Miss
Wetheral?" Tom Pynsent began to feel great
stoutness of heart, in proportion as Anna Maria
grew timid and embarrassed.</p>

<p>"I shall be happy&mdash;we shall feel&mdash;&mdash;." She
hesitated.</p>

<p>"To be sure; well, then, I shall be at Wetheral
to-morrow, and, if you are not fatigued, I
will show you a monstrous fine view."</p>

<p>"But your hunting-day is to-morrow, Mr.
Pynsent."</p>

<p>"Never mind hunting for a day or so, Miss
Wetheral; I don't mind being laughed at. I
want very much to show you that view, so mind
we are engaged to-morrow."</p>

<p>How lightly did Miss Wetheral's heart beat
at that moment! how was she repaid for months
of miserable feeling!</p>

<p>It was during the bustle of breaking up, that
Miss Wycherly glided towards Julia, and unbosomed
her feelings.</p>

<p>"My dear soul, I am the most wretched woman
existing; that creature has vexed me to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
soul with his flirtation, and my only hope is
that I have given him a tweak in return."</p>

<p>"Take care, Penelope!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall care about nothing but repiquing.
As long as Spottiswoode flirts with Lady Anna,
so long I shall flirt with that half spoony Tyndal
junior, if my heart breaks under it. How happy
you are, Julia, and how miserable am I! You
have chained your lover, whereas, mine bounds
away at a touch. Now, there, look at him,
cloaking Lady Anna, as if she was made of spun
glass, and bringing her just under my very eyes.
I will bear that man's insult with perfect gaiety&mdash;watch
me now&mdash;good night!"</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly passed on with apparent light-heartedness,
and addressed Lady Anna Herbert.</p>

<p>"How you have footed it this night, Lady
Anna! Mr. Henry Tyndal declares you are the
pride of Shropshire in a ball-room. I was quite
jealous. Lord Farnborough is waiting for you,
with Lady Jessy, but I shall tell them you are
too agreeably occupied to move away yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, really I am quite ready," replied
her ladyship: "but Mr. Spottiswoode's compliments
are so lengthy, they will never arrive at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
conclusion; what do you think he has been saying?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess, Lady Anna.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Will ye gang to the bourne, Marion,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Will ye gang to the bourne with me?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I can't continue the song, for my father beckons,
but fare you well." Miss Wycherly kissed her
hand playfully, and walked gaily up the room,
which was thinning very fast.</p>

<p>"That was excellently done," observed Lady
Ennismore to Julia, as they proceeded to the
carriage, "but it will cost your friend her night's
rest, and her lover into the bargain. That fragment
of song, and the careless manner which accompanied
its delivery, will throw the gentleman
into Lady Anna's power."</p>

<p>Anna Maria was escorted to the carriage by
Tom Pynsent, and Lady Wetheral triumphantly
and delightedly invited him to Wetheral, whenever
he felt inclined to do them honour by his
presence.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mr. Pynsent, Lady Spottiswoode's
parties bear away the bell amongst us; every
thing is so agreeably arranged, so many extremely
pleasant people gathered together! Wetheral
will prove fast-days after such an evening as this,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
but fasts are enjoined, you know. Mortifications
are proper to subdue the spirit."</p>

<p>"I am engaged to ride with Miss Wetheral
to-morrow," replied Tom Pynsent, with a slight
hesitation of speech, and a remarkably silly look.
"I am to show her a monstrous fine view."</p>

<p>"How very kind! my daughter is not acquainted
with our <i>distant</i> views, Mr. Pynsent,
and your polite attention will be the means of
increasing her pleasures. Miss Wetheral delights
in fine scenery. You must dine with us,
my dear sir; we shall not allow you to run away
after, perhaps, a long and fatiguing ride. My
dear Lord Ennismore, thank you for bringing me
Julia, but where is her ladyship?"</p>

<p>"Lord Farnborough is escorting my mother;
our carriage has just drawn up, and she begs you
will drive on without waiting for her. She is
talking to the Farnboroughs, and I am going to
join her. We shall be at Wetheral before you."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, your horses are much too speedy for
<i>my</i> fears. Well, then, my dear Julia, we will proceed
at once into the carriage."</p>

<p>Lord Ennismore handed Julia to the carriage,
and returned to join his mother.</p>

<p>"Excellent young man," exclaimed Lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Wetheral, "I always admired Ennismore, but
his filial attentions are beautiful."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent could not forbear a smile at
her ladyship's enthusiastic admiration; he wished
the party good night.</p>

<p>"Good night, good night," said Lady Wetheral
and Julia, kissing their hands to the receding
figure of Mr. Pynsent. Anna Maria did
not speak her adieus, neither did she wave her
hand, but she bent forward to watch the last
glimpse of his athletic form, as it disappeared
among the groups, who were waiting for their
carriages.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>Tom Pynsent's ride with Miss Wetheral only
led the way to repeated engagements at Wetheral
on his part, and on Lady Wetheral's
side, to affectionate welcomes and smiles upon
his entrance. At every opportunity, and upon
every occasion, Tom Pynsent was appointed to
take charge of "dear Anna Maria," and her ladyship
thanked him in flattering terms for the delightful
accession of health which Miss Wetheral
had gained by constant and agreeable horse-exercise.</p>

<p>Anna Maria did, indeed, gain both health and
happiness from the repeated <i>tête-à-têtes</i> which
fell to her lot with the man she loved. The
tone of conversation, his shy manner&mdash;so like
his manner with Julia&mdash;his anxiety to form fresh
engagements to meet again; all convinced her
his affections were surrendered to herself. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
cheek resumed its bloom, her eye regained its
brightness, and her figure became more elastic;
there was hope in her smiles, and lightness in
her movements, which formed an extraordinary
change in the once insipid Miss Wetheral. Anna
Maria must ever appear gentle and peculiarly
feminine, but she was no longer painfully inert
or tranquil, to a death-like stillness. It was a
rapid and complete change; a change which
proved how powerfully unrequited love had dealt
with a heart which could now rise at the touch
of affection, from torpid listlessness, to the joys
of life; which could spring at once from cold and
weary melancholy, to the light and warmth of a
joyous mind, revelling in happy prospects.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral perceived Tom Pynsent's
attentions with pleasure. His honest heart and
honourable feelings promised every happiness, he
said, to a woman who could prefer heart to head,
and, if Anna Maria had the sense to choose him
instead of the lordlings whom Julia coveted, he
could insure her a happy married life, if it were
not her own fault. He wished he could prophecy
equal content to Julia, but she had planned her
own marriage, and she must abide the issue;
Lady Wetheral must blame herself, if Julia was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
unhappy, for she had brought up her daughters
to consider wealth and station a balance to the
weight of matrimonial misery, and her remarks
and sentiments taught Julia to believe she had
done well in selling herself to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral never could endure her husband's
observations, when they touched upon
her government of children, and his present remarks
brought down a thousand reproaches.</p>

<p>"I think, Sir John, you might spare me what
I can only term abuse, and which you level at
me now upon all occasions."</p>

<p>"My dear, you are wrong; abuse never issues
from my lips."</p>

<p>"I call that abuse," she returned, "which
throws blame over all my actions, and which is
not true. You are imputing, I may say, infamous
motives to me; and, while I am ever
ready to advance my daughter's happy and respectable
establishments, you thunder blame
from your study, yet never assist yourself in a
work of so much importance. Had it not been
for me, Lord Ennismore would never have proposed
to Julia, and, had I not watched Tom
Pynsent, and drawn him constantly to Wetheral,
he might never have transferred his affections to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Anna Maria. In all this, Sir John, you have
never assisted me; and what your conscience
will accuse you of on your death-bed, I know
not; mine will give me consolation in my last
hour, in thinking I have performed my duties to
my children. You are obstinately resolved to
imagine Julia is marrying against her better
judgment; but, my love, your time and mine is
gone by, and we must not judge of a young
woman's affection by our own feelings. I can
quite understand Julia's attachment to Lord
Ennismore, and she could not be expected to
forego that attachment, to please your fastidious
taste."</p>

<p>"This is not a matter of taste," replied Sir
John; "it involves a deep principle. Julia is
marrying Ennismore, because his title has blinded
her judgment; her ambition is gratified, and her
affections are yielded up to its influence. Your
sentiments have fostered her conduct, and you
will suffer by its effects, Gertrude."</p>

<p>"Sir John, any one would think you a professed
booby," exclaimed his lady, warmly;
"any one would suppose you mad to hear you
croaking and grieving, because your daughter is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
on the point of marriage with a peer of large
fortune, and excellent character."</p>

<p>"Ennismore has no character at all, Gertrude."</p>

<p>"Then Julia will govern him, Sir John; don't
be uneasy about that."</p>

<p>"Not while his mother lives."</p>

<p>"Nonsense; Julia will do what she pleases;
don't talk to me of old mothers; who ever minds
their mothers? If Tom Pynsent cared for his
mother, he would not pay attention to Anna
Maria. No, no, that is a very poor plea against
Lord Ennismore. If Tom Pynsent would propose
at once, my girls might marry the same
day; he intends to propose, of course, but he is
a long time about it. He was quicker in asking
Julia."</p>

<p>"He has learned experience," said her husband,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Men are so stupid," returned Lady Wetheral;
"they show their intentions, and yet
linger at the threshold. I will find out his meaning
the next time we meet, but I shall enter
upon the subject with great tact&mdash;you need not
look so alarmed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Remember the fate of Mrs. Primrose's attack
upon Mr. Thornhill, Gertrude."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral affected not to hear when any
subject offended or interfered with her ideas of
propriety; in this case, she was absolutely deaf,
and her thoughts took a more excursive range.</p>

<p>"When my two daughters are disposed of,
Clara will, of course, come forward, and her remarkable
style of beauty will soon attract attention
and admiration. I do not consider Clara
particularly gifted, but her appearance will more
than balance her want of intellect. Your pet,
Chrystal, as you call her, will be a sort of companion
for her, though the child is disgustingly
forward and pert, as I always prognosticated she
would be."</p>

<p>Christobelle was seated upon a stool at her
father's feet, when this dialogue took place; he
patted her head at the conclusion of Lady Wetheral's
speech, and observed how companionable
she had been, and still proved to be, in his solitude.
"If," he remarked, "the other girls had
been brought up to study, instead of being married
from the nursery, they would prove better
companions and better wives, in the duties they
are resolved to encounter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is a remark so like you, my dear, that
I am somewhat weary of the dull round of sentiment;
Miss Chrystal, what are you poring
over?"</p>

<p>Christobelle rose, and presented her book.</p>

<p>"Ah, very well; Miss Edgeworth is very
clever with her chemistry, and that prattling
Rosamond, but she never married, and never
will marry. I never allowed my girls to read
these kind of books, to make them careless about
their appearance, and disagreeably learned to
men. I never found a clever woman anxious to
please, and in general they do some extraordinary
thing or other, like Miss Wycherly, who is
clever, but she drives herself about in a very
masculine manner. There, my dear, take back
your book; if you turn out a reading lady, you
will be an object of dislike, and men will shun
you; but, pray remember, you belong to your
father; <i>I</i> have no hand in your education."</p>

<p>"Chrystal will be a treasure to the man
who wins her," said Sir John.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, she will do for Leslie, or be a
treasure to that dirty antiquarian, Cromleholm's
son, Philip; but I wish to ask your opinion;
must we really have Mrs. Pynsent at Julia's
wedding?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"How can you avoid it, Gertrude?"</p>

<p>"I wish I knew some method of avoiding the
invitation, without giving offence."</p>

<p>"How so? You have formed an intimacy
with her, and professed to esteem her."</p>

<p>"That's another thing. One esteems people
for different reasons, and esteem means nothing.
I always kept up an intimacy for the girls' sakes,
but I cannot endure her very abrupt manners.
She is very offensive."</p>

<p>"My dear Gertrude, you must manage your
own affairs: you formed the intimacy, to my
great astonishment."</p>

<p>"I never receive assistance from you, Sir
John. Never mind how or why I formed the
intimacy; it is sufficient that I wish to escape
her society at Julia's wedding; can I manage it?"</p>

<p>"I think not."</p>

<p>"I must then endure her. I see Mr. Pynsent,
Tom I mean, riding up the park; I must
seek Anna Maria." Lady Wetheral hastily
quitted the apartment.</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent arrived, and was ushered into
the sitting-room, where Lady Wetheral was
seated alone; she was apparently startled by his
entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Pynsent, there is an old saying,
and not a very refined one, which has been
exemplified in myself at this moment. I was
thinking of you, and wishing to see you, as
you entered."</p>

<p>"I am much obliged, Lady Wetheral; I am
sure I am very much honoured by your thoughts;
but where are the ladies?"</p>

<p>"Lady Ennismore has <i>chaperoned</i> some of
the party in a drive to Shrewsbury. Lewis's
shop has so many attractions for young people!"</p>

<p>"Is Miss Wetheral gone?" asked Tom Pynsent,
in a tone of disappointment. "I want a
hat, and I'll take this opportunity of riding to
Shrewsbury. Any thing I can do for you,
Lady Wetheral?"</p>

<p>"I have given Julia a commission, thank you.
Anna Maria did not join the party. She is not
very well this morning."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent had risen to depart; he now
reseated himself.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you have no commission to give me,
I shall not ride so far; I can get a hat any
time. I hope Miss Wetheral is not confined
to her room."</p>

<p>"My daughter is not well, Mr. Pynsent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
She looks much, very much improved by her
exercise on horseback, and I am complimented
upon her brilliant complexion and spirits, but I
am not easy about her. I hope her fine complexion
betrays no seeds of consumption; her
spirits are not the spirits of health, I much
fear."</p>

<p>"Good God! you don't think so!" cried Tom
Pynsent, in alarm. "I thought Miss Wetheral
never looked better than she has done for some
weeks past."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral shook her head.</p>

<p>"There is something not quite right, and I
was wishing to see you, to observe that perhaps
riding-exercise was too violent for her constitution.
I think I must advise her to drive out in
the phaeton, and try its effect; but many thanks
are due to you, my dear Mr. Pynsent, for your
kind and regular attendance upon my daughter.
I have often heard her express much gratitude
towards you."</p>

<p>"I shall be very happy, I am sure, to drive
Miss Wetheral in any open carriage," remarked
Tom, perfectly obtuse to the aim and end of his
companion's purpose. "I can drive her to very
many pleasant views."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thank you most sincerely for your more
than kind politeness towards my daughter, which
we all appreciate; but, my dear Mr. Pynsent,
we must not draw down unnecessary observation;
people are always inclined to remark upon&mdash;I
think I must decline your agreeable offer,
though with pain&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Well, and what can any one say if I drive
out Miss Wetheral? There is no harm in attending
an invalid in a drive, is there?"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral laughed and coughed a little.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Pynsent; no harm, though you
have represented it so humorously; but remarks
will be made, and are made. As a
mother I feel those remarks, and I particularly
beg you to understand, that it is quite against
my own ideas of right&mdash;quite in opposition to
my own feelings, that I am painfully called
upon to withdraw my daughter from being
publicly seen so frequently in your company,
attended only by her servant."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent twirled his hat, and was silent.
Her ladyship proceeded.</p>

<p>"If the world, Mr. Pynsent, would only allow
us to be happy our own way, how many agreeable
hours might be enjoyed which are now denied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
us! Perhaps, as a mother, I <i>was</i> wrong in
throwing my daughter so much in the society
of a very agreeable man&mdash;the world says so;
but I have the strongest dependence upon the
discretion and dignity of all my daughters,
therefore I have no fears: however, something
is due to public opinion, and to that severe
mentor, attribute the necessity of this painful
task. I hope I have not given offence by my
sincerity, Mr. Pynsent?"</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent was taken by surprise; his
agreeable rides were ended, and his attendance
upon Anna Maria at once suspended by the
breath of public opinion. There was but one
way of recovering his former position at Wetheral,
and Lady Wetheral had won the day!</p>

<p>"I think it very extraordinary that I am not
to ride with a lady I like. Do you think, Lady
Wetheral, a man is to be blamed if a lady refuses
him, and he should like to propose to
another?"</p>

<p>"I should consider a gentleman very weak
who pined for a woman's indifferent heart, Mr.
Pynsent," replied her ladyship, turning away
to conceal the triumphant expression of her
countenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad you are of my opinion, Lady
Wetheral. I was very sorry Miss Julia refused
me, for I thought her a very nice girl, and I
was extremely attached to her; but I saw she
did not care about me. Miss Wetheral is
always kind-hearted and polite, and I don't
think she dislikes me. I am sure I don't know,
but if I thought she cared for me, I should like,
like very much to&mdash;I should like to see Miss
Wetheral, if you please. Do you think, Lady
Wetheral, she would let me see her?" Tom
Pynsent became extremely red-faced.</p>

<p>"She would see <i>you</i>, I am sure, Mr. Pynsent.
Anna Maria said particularly this morning, 'If
Mr. Pynsent calls, I shall see him, but no other
gentleman.' I will ring, and let her know you
are here."</p>

<p>There was silence for some minutes; at length
her Ladyship rose.</p>

<p>"I make no apology for leaving you a short
time alone, Mr. Pynsent. My daughter will
soon take my place, and we shall consider you
our guest for the day. I make no stranger of
you. I must attend an appointment with our
bailiff, and their complaints are without end.
Sir John often makes Roberts over to me. Do
not let me find you flown upon my return."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope I shall not have occasion to depart,
Lady Wetheral," said Tom Pynsent, struggling
for composure.</p>

<p>"I will allow no departure, Mr. Pynsent.
Anna Maria must detain you prisoner till Roberts
allows me to escape. Mind, I lay my
commands upon you to remain at Wetheral."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral had scarcely closed the door
upon her own exit, when Anna Maria entered
at the opposite end of the room, blooming and
happy; her eyes sparkled with pleasure, as they
rested upon Tom Pynsent.</p>

<p>"I only heard of your arrival this instant,"
she said, as they shook hands; "you have not
been here alone long, I hope."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent placed a chair for the young
lady, and seated himself near her, but for some
moments he did not speak. Miss Wetheral
looked at him with surprise. Tom Pynsent at
length broke the awkward pause.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you are ill, Miss Wetheral."</p>

<p>"I never was better in my life, Mr. Pynsent,"
replied Anna Maria, smiling. "What makes
you suppose I am ill?"</p>

<p>"I thought you looked very well, Miss
Wetheral, but I was told you were poorly, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
I am sure you look as little like a consumptive
person as any one I ever saw!"</p>

<p>"Who could invent such a fable?" inquired
Anna Maria.</p>

<p>"I have heard something worse than that,"
continued Tom, hesitating, and walking to the
window.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! about me! or any unpleasant
news from Hatton?"</p>

<p>"Lady Wetheral says we are not to ride
again together. I think it a very extraordinary
thing, don't you?" Tom Pynsent looked at the
distant Wrekin to appear unconcerned. He received
no reply from Anna Maria.</p>

<p>"I think it a monstrous folly to deny one
those kind of things," proceeded Tom, turning
towards his companion, who sat gazing at him,
pale as her own muslin dress. He was shocked
at her appearance, and, forgetting his shyness in
affectionate solicitude, he took both her hands
in his.</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral, do you mind it as much as
I do? Just tell me if you mind it as I do?"</p>

<p>Anna Maria could only answer in alarm, and
almost involuntarily "Yes."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent could not command his feelings;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
he caught her in his arms, and saluted her with
a kiss, which might have been distinctly heard
in the hall.</p>

<p>"I like a girl who speaks her mind without
affectation and nonsense, and there's a good
fox-hunting kiss from your husband, if you will
make me so, and we will ride together in spite
of the devil."</p>

<p>Miss Wetheral's astonishment at the action,
and her happiness at her lover's subsequent
speech, prevented all reply; but she gave him
her hand at once, though her face was covered
with blushes. Tom Pynsent squeezed the little
white hand with rapture, and her open dealing
made a taciturn lover garrulous with approval.</p>

<p>"You <i>do</i> let me squeeze your hand, and you do
<i>not</i> pretend to be offended because a man tells
you he loves you! Who would have thought
you were such an open-hearted, dear creature,
without a bit of nonsense? Now, give me your
other hand&mdash;there's a dear, beautiful girl as you
are, and we may ride now to the world's end
together. Perhaps, when we are married, you
will ride with me to see the hounds throw off.
I shall only hunt then three times a week.
Lady Wetheral frightened me properly, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
she forbid my riding with you; however, I shall
stay here to-day, and we can talk over things.
You will walk with me, my dear girl, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"I am in a labyrinth, I really am bewildered,
Mr. Pynsent," replied Miss Wetheral, timidly.
"Do not fancy me silly, but I really am bewildered,
and hardly know what to say."</p>

<p>"You have said enough, quite enough," cried
Tom Pynsent, squeezing her poor hands into
his enormous palms. "You have accepted me,
and I shan't allow you to leave me; I shall
follow you like a dog till we are married: a
little walk will be the very thing to refresh you.
Let us walk in the park, and look at the Wrekin,
and talk of our wedding-day."</p>

<p>Miss Wetheral mechanically obeyed her lover's
request; and they were deeply absorbed in conversation,
pacing up and down the avenue, when
the party drove home from Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Primrose has succeeded tolerably well,
Sir John," observed Lady Wetheral, in the interim
between Tom Pynsent's departure and the
lighting of the chamber-candles&mdash;"Mrs. Primrose
has caught Mr. Thornhill, in despite of
your alarms." This was whispered to reach Sir
John's ear only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Ennismore had something very obliging
to say, and whenever she spoke, her flattering
compliments soothed the ear of her object&mdash;she
only framed sentences of compliment.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Wetheral, a certain gentleman's
gallant and unequivocal admiration of a
nameless beauty, proves his excellent discriminating
powers. I admire the lover, and approve
his suit. I wish I had a daughter who was fortunate
enough to attract Mr. Pynsent."</p>

<p>Anna Maria did not love Lady Ennismore;
she even shrank from her address in general; yet
her expressed approval of Tom Pynsent at once
gained belief, and gave pleasure to her heart.
On all sides, congratulations awaited her. Her
father added his approval, and it was given with
feeling and earnestness. Before all the assembled
family-party, he told her he had no fears
for her welfare, as the wife of an honest,
high-principled man. He could congratulate her
upon an engagement which must bring happiness
to a woman who valued the texture of a
heart such as Pynsent possessed. His wealth
might surround her person with luxuries, but
his good qualities alone could secure her peace
of mind. He trusted Anna Maria would appreciate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and hold fast the affections of her future
husband, and her lot would fall upon good
ground. Pynsent was a man to whom he could
intrust a daughter's happiness, and have no fears
for her futurity.</p>

<p>Anna Maria's spirits were subdued under her
father's earnest observations; her happiness, the
suddenness of the event, and her future prospects,
combined with the congratulations of her family,
overpowered a mind which had long borne the
alternations of hope, suspense, and fear. She
sought refuge in her own room; Lady Wetheral
and Julia followed; the one to offer soothing
remedies, and to rejoice with her sister in the
termination of her sorrow; the other to triumph
in the success of her scheme: her ladyship's
delight was boundless. To marry two daughters
in one day to the first matches in Shropshire
and Staffordshire, seemed an affair beyond common
calculation: the lottery of life rarely threw
two prizes consecutively into a family; and certainly
her own generalship had secured both.
In the exuberance of her spirits, she confessed to
the sisters the ruse she had practised to elicit
an offer from Tom Pynsent. Anna Maria was
distressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, how could you take such a
method; practising upon Tom's fears to hasten
a declaration! How you frighten me; I might
have lost him!"</p>

<p>"Poor Greenhorn! no, you had no chance of
losing him; he was too much in love. I only
prepared the way for him, to hasten the catastrophe.
I particularly wished him to propose,
because my mind is bent upon the double wedding,
therefore I applied the goad very gently,
but he answered the whip. The instant I mentioned
your rides being discontinued, I saw the
thing was done. My only hope now is, that
Clara may succeed as you have done. There
will be some difficulty in obtaining Mrs. Pynsent's
consent perhaps, but I do not doubt a
little management may succeed <i>there</i> too. Mrs.
Pynsent is violent, but seldom firm; she will
chafe and use very strong language, but she
will be busy and delighted at your wedding, my
love."</p>

<p>"But why do you consider Mrs. Pynsent
objects, mamma?" asked Anna Maria, in alarm.</p>

<p>"Oh, she has some stupid notion that I have
laid plans for her son, I fancy. Now, to suppose
that I hunt for sons-in-law is absolute absurdity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
I wish my children to marry well, I
confess, but no one detests fortune-hunting more
than I do. I consider a man&#339;uvring mother a
nuisance in society, and, therefore, Mrs. Pynsent's
notion is ridiculous&mdash;too ridiculous even
to confute. I shall get your father to make an
intimate acquaintance with Sir Foster Kerrison,
Julia. He is a widower, but his eleven children
would not interfere with Clara's comforts: some
may die, and the others might be sent to school.
I don't believe a word about his kicking his
servants; if scandalous reports were believed,
very few of us could escape infamy. Servants
are vile creatures, and would destroy <i>any</i> character.
Sir Foster is a very fine man, and not
to be rejected because he may occasionally lose
his temper. There are many provocations in
life, which now and then cause a man's temper
to ferment a little, but what would that signify
to Clara? Tom Pynsent uses a few, perhaps,
unnecessary oaths, but he means nothing; his
temper is excellent: Sir Foster probably means no
more. I shall ask his eldest daughter to Wetheral,
when you are all gone; indeed, I shall require
amusement; my spirits will be depressed enough
when that melancholy day arrives, my dear girls."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Wetheral's voice fell, and a deep sigh
succeeded: she soon resumed, more gaily&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall consider that day a proud and happy
one, which allows me to give you to two of the
best of men, after all, my loves. It will be my
glory to see you united to men standing high in
situation, excellent in conduct, possessing the
means of showering luxuries upon you, and
placing you at the head of magnificent establishments.
Should Clara form an equally
wealthy connexion, I should die in peace; but
I can only consider Sir Foster Kerrison worthy
to be related to you. If he has eleven children,
he has immense estates in three counties, and I
must manage to get Miss Kerrison to Wetheral.
I should fear nothing, if Clara would only keep
her temper; but I dread the daughter carrying
tales back to Ripley: however, I will manage
as well as I can, for something must be effected
on my side. Good night, my dear girls; I hope
you will have sons, and no daughters, for you
cannot know a mother's anxiety about daughters&mdash;they
depend so entirely upon forming
proper establishments. Your poor father would
never have interested himself about you. I do
believe he would be perfectly satisfied if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
considered you destined to live hereafter as
spinsters, huddled together in a lodging in
Shrewsbury. Be well, Anna Maria; and, in
future, you know I have no business to interfere
with your rides and drives."</p>

<p>Her ladyship quitted the room, smiling complacently
at the remembrance of her successful
ruse; and the sisters were left together, to rejoice
in and compare their happy prospects.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral's idea of Mrs. Pynsent's objection,
and her short-lived but violent wrath,
was exemplified in her conduct, when her son
stated his engagement to Miss Wetheral, before
his parents, the morning subsequent to his proposal.</p>

<p>"Now hang me, Tom, if I would have believed
such a thing from any body's lips but
your own. So you have taken a bird out of the
Wetheral nest, have you? You have been
hunted down, neatly, Master Tom."</p>

<p>"In this particular," replied her son, "I
have made my own choice, and my father made
no objection when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who minds your father?" interrupted Mrs.
Pynsent; "he never knows what he is about.
He says 'yes' to every thing, and looks like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
booby besides. Now you may marry the girl,
and take Hatton if you please, but I'll be
hanged if <i>I</i> notice her! I'm serious, Master
Tom."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent allowed the storm to spend its
fury, and Mrs. Pynsent proceeded with increased
ire.</p>

<p>"To be gulled into marriage by that woman,
Wetheral, drives me wild; but I never saw the
man yet, who was not tricked into a trap by an
artful woman, in spite of his teeth. Hang the
whole set of them, and you too, for being a
greater simpleton than your father!"</p>

<p>"If I was a simpleton," observed Mr. Pynsent,
quietly, "it was in marrying a masculine
lady."</p>

<p>"You be hanged, Bobby! you proposed to
every girl you met. I was your fiftieth love,
and you knew Sally Hancock and myself loved
things out of the common way. I tell you what,
Bobby&mdash;if Tom marries a Wetheral, you and I
leave Shropshire. I won't stay in the country.
If I meet her, I'll drive over her, Tom."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent understood his mother's disposition,
and acted accordingly. He assured her
of his sorrow in perceiving her dislike to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
match; but, whatever disgust she might feel
towards Lady Wetheral's conduct, the daughter
was not involved in its folly. "When," continued
he, "I proposed to Julia Wetheral, <i>she</i>
refused me at once."</p>

<p>"You proposed to another of them!" cried
Mrs. Pynsent, "and Bill Wycherly was right!
You got huffed by one Wetheral, and then turned
to another! Is this a true bill? Then I only just
ask you, if simpleton is not too gentle an expression,
Master Tommy, for such a poor thing as
yourself? I only just ask you, if you don't think
you are as nice an owl as ever was taken in by a
set of man&#339;uvring women? You'll hear enough
of this, Tommy Pynsent! You and my Lord
Ennismore are a couple of tight boys to be gulled
by my lady. Here, make way for me&mdash;that I
may go and tell my sister Hancock what a nice
lad Master Pynsent has turned out. Never expect
me to go near Wetheral, Bobby. I would
sooner visit old Nick."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent flung out of the room, with an
air of offended majesty.</p>

<p>"Let your mother alone, Tom," said Mr.
Pynsent, as the door closed upon his indignant
lady. "Let her alone, and she won't long refuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
her consent. When she has unburthened her
mind to Sally Hancock, and fizzed a little, all
will be right again."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent ordered her pony-carriage, and
drove off to Lea Cottage, where her widowed
sister resided upon a very small income. Mrs.
Hancock was darning stockings, when her sister
appeared before her with inflamed features.</p>

<p>"Hollo, Pen, what's the matter now?" cried
Mrs. Hancock, calmly continuing her darn.&mdash;"What's
in the wind, now, Pen?"</p>

<p>"I am in a pretty mess, Sally Hancock;
what do you think Tom is about to do?"</p>

<p>"Is he going to marry our niece, Wycherly?
Don't let him marry a cousin, Pen; bless you,
don't let him marry a cousin."</p>

<p>"Marry a <i>cousin</i>, Sally! I wish it was no
worse than marrying young Pen. He is going
to bring me one of Lady Wetheral's dolls, and
I have vowed not to see or speak to her."</p>

<p>"Hoot toot, you will think better of it," replied
Mrs. Hancock, passing a stocking to her
sister. "Do mend that for me&mdash;there's a hole
in the heel, as big as my thumb. What's the
matter with the Wetherals, Pen? They are very
fine girls, and very well born."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not <i>that</i>," returned Mrs. Pynsent,
threading a needle, and taking up the proffered
stocking. "If you knew the pains my lady took
to hunt down Tom, you would bless yourself,
Sally Hancock."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Pen. Didn't our mother do
just the same by us? Didn't I marry Hancock,
in spite of every thing people could say?&mdash;and
didn't you declare you would have Bob Pynsent,
though he was engaged to Patty Durham?"</p>

<p>"Sally Hancock, do you remember the
Shrewsbury races?" cried Mrs. Pynsent, overpowered
with laughing at some bygone recollections.</p>

<p>"When we dressed up to frighten Hancock
and Pynsent? ay, don't I?" exclaimed her sister,
equally amused. "Do you remember Hancock's
face, when you told him his fortune?"</p>

<p>"And do you remember Pynsent saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent could no more. A thousand
images of the past crowded before her vision,
and both ladies laughed immoderately at certain
remembrances conjured up by Mrs. Hancock,
reverting to youthful indiscretions. Mrs. Pynsent's
anger towards her son already waned, as
she dwelt upon topics so consonant to her feelings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
with her sister. The <i>tête-à-tête</i> lasted a
considerable time, and the peals of laughter
continued, till the completion of the stocking
gave warning it was time to part. Mrs. Pynsent
prepared to move with reluctance.</p>

<p>"Can't you stay now you are here?" said
Mrs. Hancock.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me, Sally Hancock. I must get
back to Hatton. If you and Hancock had not
spent your property in eating and drinking, you
would not have been shut up here with that
dreadful foot, which must be your death."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hancock exhibited her swelled foot.&mdash;"Yes,
that's a neat article, Pen. I wish I could
have it sawed off by the carpenter. Can't help
it."</p>

<p>"Well, Sally Hancock, if Tom marries, you
must come to the wedding;" remarked Mrs.
Pynsent, in a doleful voice.</p>

<p>"My dear, how can I come with this foot?
A pretty trinket, isn't it, to present before a
bride?&mdash;There's a neat foot to trip among the
bridesmaids to the altar!&mdash;I'm only fit for Lea,
Pen, but you can tell me all about it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent drew up her face and eyes into
a comic expression of astonishment, as she contemplated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
her sister's foot, veiled from the public
gaze in the recess of a large list shoe.</p>

<p>"Well, Sally Hancock, you gave a good price
for it. There's a hundred thousand pounds' worth
in that hovel of a shoe. Every farthing melted
into your stomachs. It was sure to tell upon
you, some day."</p>

<p>"We can't eat our cake and have it," observed
the jolly Mrs. Hancock; "but it wasn't
<i>all</i> spent in eating and drinking. Hancock and
myself lost more than half at play. It didn't all
go in eating and drinking, Pen. Poor Hancock
was very violent when I was unlucky, but he
thought nothing about his own losses."</p>

<p>"You would have him, Sally Hancock."</p>

<p>"Well, I was as resolute as yourself in the
matter of Bob Pynsent, Pen; but all the Wycherlys
were a rum set&mdash;must, and would have
their own way. Give Tom credit for a slice of
the family disorder, and pocket the affront."</p>

<p>"How my lady will hector, and compliment,
and courtesy!" shuddered Mrs. Pynsent.</p>

<p>"Never mind my lady! When is it to take
place?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know; I was in such a fury, I
asked no questions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell Tom I will congratulate him, if he will
come and see me." Mrs. Hancock winked her
eye.</p>

<p>"Tom never will come near you till you leave
off your broad jokes, Sally Hancock. I wish
you would not offend people in that way. I
can't ask you among ladies and gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Lord, Pen, how can I leave off old habits
at my time of life?" Mrs. Hancock put her
finger to her eye and looked innocent.</p>

<p>"Then Bobby and Tom will never visit you, or
allow me to ask you to Hatton for more than
one day. That's all you get by old habits, Sally
Hancock."</p>

<p>"Tom is mighty nice; I wouldn't give a farthing
for such a nephew."</p>

<p>"I'll trouble you not to abuse Tom, Sally
Hancock," cried her sister, who was touched on
a most sensitive point by this remark. "Tom
is always right, and his mother will always uphold
him. You must have a very genteel dialect,
when two gentlemen cannot sit in your society
comfortably."</p>

<p>"When shall I see you again? don't be scolding,
Pen; I'm not used to scolding, now poor
Hancock is gone."</p>

<p>"I'll come to Lea, as soon as Tom's affairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
are settled, but never call Tom names before me,
Sally Hancock; you know I cannot bear it.
Tom shall marry too if he pleases, and no one
shall offer an opinion against the match before
<i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Nor before me either," cried Mrs. Hancock.</p>

<p>"Before <i>you</i>! who ever comes before you, except
myself?" asked Mrs. Pynsent, stopping
short, as they were advancing towards the door,
at which the pony-carriage was drawn up.</p>

<p>"Oh! Tomkins, the exciseman, comes for a
bit of chat, and the old Ripley housekeeper has
retired here, so I often hear the news. This is
a very cheerful place."</p>

<p>"Don't frighten away the exciseman, Sally
Hancock."</p>

<p>"Never fear, Pen; the exciseman is not made
of such dainty materials as my nephew."</p>

<p>So ended the interview between the sisters;
and Mrs. Pynsent returned to Hatton, resolved
internally to support her son's wishes, and to
offend any person who presumed to reflect upon
his taking a "Wetheral."</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>News of any trifling occurrence passes rapidly
round a neighbourhood; but news of bridal import
speeds with increased velocity through every
department. It was soon known to every individual
in the establishment, that Mr. Pynsent
was accepted by Miss Wetheral, and in less than
twenty-four hours the event was generally current
in the higher circles of the Wetheral acquaintance.
Separated as many mansions were
from each other's observation by large intermediate
property, it was wonderful how the intelligence
could gain such powerful progress,
yet it was publicly spoken of as an assured fact
the following evening at Lady Spottiswoode's;
and Lady Wetheral's extraordinary good fortune
was canvassed in every particular.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent's publicly-expressed disapprobation
of a daughter-in-law from Wetheral, was
commented upon with eagerness, and many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
anxious friends of both parties looked with
mingled curiosity and amusement to the effects
likely to emanate from Hatton. Miss Wycherly
consented to escort a party upon a congratulatory
mission to her aunt Pynsent, and she undertook
to drive Lady Spottiswoode and her
daughter to Hatton, accompanied by the two
Mr. Tyndals.</p>

<p>It was an evil day to Miss Wycherly. Ever
since the eventful ball, which produced the present
cause of her intended visit, Mr. Spottiswoode
had never renewed the subject which she had
treated so lightly, or sought her society, his once
constant anxiety and invariable daily practice.
Since that eventful ball, so happy in its results to
one party, so gloomy in its termination to herself&mdash;since
that night, when her rash spirits tempted
her to jest with her lover's serious wish to understand
her sentiments, had Mr. Spottiswoode
been a stranger to Lidham; and most rashly had
Miss Wycherly persevered in flirting with Mr.
Henry Tyndal, to evince her indifference to Mr.
Spottiswoode's prolonged absence, and to bring
down upon herself, ultimately, the reproach of
having given encouragement to Henry Tyndal
ungenerously and dishonourably. Her present
state of mind towards Mr. Spottiswoode was unchangeable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
affection, such as it had ever felt towards
him; and such as she felt assured must
ever exist there, though her own lips had made
a breach between them, by trifling with his long-expressed
affection.</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly felt aware that she had drawn
down upon herself the offended feelings of
an injured man, who had borne all her caprice
with patient endurance; she felt, too, that there
was a point when that endurance must and would
burst from its fetters, and assert its freedom.
Mr. Spottiswoode's spirit might bear with a certain
degree of flippancy; but he would not endure
to become a woman's toy, to become a
thing, which the woman he loved could dare to
throw from her in caprice, and recall at will.
Such, Miss Wycherly knew, was not the nature
of <i>his</i> love, whom her heart pined to recover.
But her pride&mdash;the pride of a woman unwilling
to bend her spirit in acknowledgment of error&mdash;persisted
in allowing Henry Tyndal to attend
her in public; and its false reasoning forbade
her to appear wounded by the consequences of
her fault. Miss Wycherly could only trust to
circumstances for assistance in developing the
real intentions of her offended lover; and, in
making an appointment with Lady Spottiswoode,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
she trusted events might concur to restore her
again into her son's favour, and dispel the cloud
which separated them.</p>

<p>In this frame of mind, and with this hope, to
spread flowers on her path, Miss Wycherly drove
her four beautiful bays into Shrewsbury, and
drew up before Lady Spottiswoode's house.
Mr. Spottiswoode, accompanied by the Tyndals,
appeared at the hall-door to receive her; and
Mr. Spottiswoode politely, but with reserve of
voice and manner, expressed Lady Spottiswoode's
hope that she would take refreshment before
they proceeded to Hatton. This was Miss Wycherly's
first meeting with her lover, since the
misunderstanding which had taken place at Lady
Spottiswoode's ball; and her heart felt and sunk
under the changed expression of his voice and
manner. She gave her reins to the groom, and
prepared to obey Lady Spottiswoode's request.
Mr. Henry Tyndal went forward with his brother
to offer their assistance, while Mr. Spottiswoode
remained on the steps, as a person who conceived
that all required attention on his part,
was effected in the delivery of his mother's message.
Miss Wycherly declined Mr. Henry Tyndal's
offered hand, and reseated herself with feelings
of mingled mortification and indignation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Nothing now could persuade her to descend
from the barouche-box.</p>

<p>"Have the goodness, Mr. Tyndal, to make
my excuses to Lady Spottiswoode. I rarely
quit my throne, when once exalted, and she will
allow of my apology. Insist upon herself and
Miss Spottiswoode taking their own time. I am
not in any hurry."</p>

<p>It appeared as though Mr. Spottiswoode had
cheerfully and for ever surrendered her to Mr.
Tyndal's attentions, for he spoke in an undertone
to the young men, and returned into the
house.</p>

<p>"Very kind fellow," cried Henry Tyndal;
"he has gone himself with your message, so I
can stay and admire your set out, and yourself.
Upon my soul, your habit sits beautifully,
doesn't it, John?"</p>

<p>"I begged <i>you</i> to deliver my message," replied
Miss Wycherly, offended and distressed at
her lover's action. "I desired <i>you</i>, Mr. Tyndal,
to deliver my message, not Mr. Spottiswoode."</p>

<p>Henry Tyndal misunderstood, and was flattered
by Miss Wycherly's reproof. It was
clear enough to his comprehension she was angry
with Spottiswoode for presuming to take a message
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
which had been delegated to himself as her
regular and encouraged attendant.</p>

<p>"Oh, well! never mind for once, Miss Wycherly;
I thought Spottiswoode was very anxious
to go, or he should not have taken my place, I
promise you. No, no, poor fellow! he was off
before I knew what he was about. Upon my
soul, your horses are magnificent."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly did not hear Mr. Tyndal's
observation; her attention was given exclusively
and painfully to the hall-door, which remained
open.</p>

<p>Lady Spottiswoode and her daughter appeared.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Wycherly, you are patience
itself," exclaimed both ladies.</p>

<p>"I never descend from my altitude," replied
Miss Wycherly; "but you look forsaken without
a beau of some sort; if your son would like
to take a seat, Lady Spottiswoode, there is one
to spare."</p>

<p>"Charles said he meant to call at Hatton,"
said Miss Spottiswoode, "and I dare say it would
really be an accommodation, unless this is the
day he promised to ride over to the Farnboroughs.
Mr. Tyndal, before you mount your
horse, just tell Charles here is room for him, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Miss Wycherly's permission&mdash;beg pardon for
the trouble."</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Tyndal sprang from his horse, and
proceeded to obey her request. Miss Wycherly
gathered up the reins, but her hands trembled
with anxious curiosity to ascertain the effect of
the summons. Mr. Henry Tyndal returned
alone.</p>

<p>"Spottiswoode says he is going to Hatton,
but he is engaged to ride there with the Farnborough
party. It has been an appointment of
some days' standing, he says, therefore he cannot
come; here he is to answer for himself."</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Spottiswoode appeared equipped
for riding, but he excused himself to Miss Wycherly
with much politeness&mdash;a style of manner
so wounding to its object, so unbearably irritating
to a self-upbraiding, yet proud, spirit.
The colour rose in Miss Wycherly's face.</p>

<p>"I am engaged to ride to Hatton with Lord
Farnborough and his daughter," proceeded Mr.
Spottiswoode: "Lady Anna commanded me to
attend her some time ago, and her ladyship
never fails her word, therefore I must not allow
her to upbraid me with the most offensive of all
failings, that of deceiving expectations. Sophy,
you are all the colours of the rainbow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind, Charles," replied Miss Spottiswoode,
smiling good-naturedly at the remark;
"if I mix pink and green too strongly for your
taste, pray remonstrate with Lady Anna Herbert;
she wears <i>three</i> colours; perhaps your
opinion may have some weight with her. I am,
you know, incorrigible."</p>

<p>"Will Lady Anna possess more sense than
her sex?" asked Mr. Spottiswoode. "Will she
relinquish three favourite tints to please?"</p>

<p>"To please <i>you</i>, Charles, I dare say Lady
Anna would renounce her darling colours&mdash;purple,
yellow, and green. Can my dear pink
and green be half so <i>prononcée</i>? Miss Wycherly,
do speak for me! Charles always upholds
Lady Anna's frightful combination."</p>

<p>"I have not upheld Lady Anna, Sophy."</p>

<p>"Yes, you always do, Charles. Every thing
is Lady Anna now."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly's spirit could endure no more;
she turned to Lady Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"We are embarked in this undertaking, and
time is precious. If Sophy has settled her interesting
topic, may I proceed to Hatton? Mr.
Tyndal, Mr. Henry Tyndal, you must not lose
sight of us; shall we proceed?"</p>

<p>The lady was perfectly ready to resign the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
conversation; the Mr. Tyndals were already
mounted, and Mr. Spottiswoode bowed his adieu.
Miss Wycherly would not appear mortified and
unhappy; she returned her lover's salutation
with a bow and smile, which equalled his own
in apparent indifference; and the party were
quickly on their road. Miss Wycherly, as
charioteer, had full occupation for her attention,
and she was silent during the drive: her
heart was heavy; and the fear of having lost
Spottiswoode's affection weighed down her spirits
and produced a mortal sorrow. Such was
the consequence of a fault persisted in, because
a false pride could not endure to own its
transgression! Such was the suffering produced by
a heart resolute to lose the man beloved, ere it
would bend to acknowledge its weakness!</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly forgot, in her own misery,
the amusement she contemplated in observing
her aunt Pynsent's conduct, when she received
the visits of congratulation upon her son's intended
marriage. In her misery, also, she did
not immediately perceive Tom Pynsent and
Miss Wetheral comfortably established in the
Hatton drawing-room; or did she, for some
moments, perceive the Ennismores and Julia
also present; while Mr. Pynsent, smilingly and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
in high spirits, was chatting in turn to the
individuals composing the circle, and calling for the
congratulations of each person upon the event
in prospect.</p>

<p>Lady Spottiswoode gazed in astonishment at
the sudden and powerful change: who could
have surmised that the "empty, horrible Wetherals"
were now to receive a thousand attentions
and affectionate solicitudes from Mrs.
Pynsent!&mdash;that "the bird from the Wetheral
nest" was to be wooed to its gilded cage by all
the gentle lures that Mrs. Pynsent could devise!&mdash;that
sweet was henceforth to be bitter,
and the bitter sweet! Lady Spottiswoode gazed,
and gazed again.</p>

<p>"Well, you are all come to say pretty things
to me," said Mrs. Pynsent, addressing the newly-arrived
party, "and you are all moonstruck!&mdash;not
a word from one of you: why, Pen, you are
all of a heap!&mdash;Well, Tyndal lads, what have
you to say?&mdash;here am I, full of bustle and happiness.
Tom is going to get married at last,
and he has made his old mother happy. We
are all happy. I tell Bobby he ought to fall
down and worship Miss Wetheral, for taking
Tom&mdash;but here, just come this way, Lady Spottiswoode."
Mrs. Pynsent lowered her voice.&mdash;"I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
didn't much like the idea of a Wetheral,
once, you remember; but that's all ended&mdash;we
won't remember old grievances."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied her ladyship&mdash;"one
has often reason to discard opinions."</p>

<p>"To be sure&mdash;can't be for ever harping upon
one string." She turned to her niece.</p>

<p>"Why, you look as if you had lost your love.
What's the matter, woman?&mdash;cheer up. Get a
good husband, Pen; and don't pay these sort of
visits with such a long face!"</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly could not command a portion
of the ever-ready spirits which had never failed
her before; her mind was too oppressed, even
to make an effort. Her aunt's observations
were unheard or unnoticed, as she turned towards
her cousin Tom, who came up, red-faced
and happy, to demand her felicitations.</p>

<p>"All right, at last, Cousin Pen: all fears
and tribulations are over. There is nothing like
fair dealing, and I have won a wife, after a
devilish sharp run, though a short one. Now
say something in your own fashion upon it,
Cousin Pen; something, as Spottiswoode says
of you, sharp, short, and sensible."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly put her hand to her eyes,
and, for a few moments, she made no reply.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Tom Pynsent believed the trembling of her
hands proceeded from fatigue.</p>

<p>"I have told you, Cousin Pen, a woman
should not drive four-in-hand; it's something
out of reason. A pair is very pretty handling;
but your little figure perched upon a box, with
four horses, won't answer. Your hands are all
in a shake, now."</p>

<p>"Let Pen alone, Tom," said Mrs. Pynsent.
"My niece is a Wycherly, and the Wycherlys
never gave in till they were fairly under ground."</p>

<p>"I am ill, aunt; very ill&mdash;a glass of water;
any thing just to revive me; my heart is bursting."
Miss Wycherly became unable to speak,
and the company surrounded her, offering every
species of condolence and remedy. A glass of
water was procured, and the cold sparkling
draught refreshed her. She felt that an effort
must be made; and it was made under sickness
of heart and prostration of mind, but the effort
had a beneficial effect, for it roused the sufferer
from a blighting sense of misery to the recollection
of present events, and she was enabled to
smile and speak to her cousin with some degree
of coherence.</p>

<p>"Tom, I do wish you happy, and I suppose
I am fatigued, for I have driven fourteen miles,
but I never was so ill before."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are ill," observed Julia Wetheral, who
had seated herself near Miss Wycherly: "it
must be something extraordinary which could
overpower <i>you</i>, Penelope. You must have felt
fatigue in mind and body with those gay horses."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly endeavoured to form a playful
reply, but a flood of tears burst forth.</p>

<p>"Say nothing to me, now, Julia&mdash;let me be
perfectly silent for a quarter of an hour, and I
shall recover."</p>

<p>Every one returned to their former seats, except
Julia, who remained silently at Miss Wycherly's
side, and the company again resumed
their interrupted conversation. Mrs. Pynsent
had her private thoughts respecting her niece's
sudden illness, which she whispered to Lady
Ennismore.</p>

<p>"Pen is never ill, and never tired with driving&mdash;she
would drive six-in-hand, and laugh at it.
I hope Pen hasn't taken a fancy to Tom: my
sister Hancock never could bear the idea of
cousins marrying."</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore smiled graciously.&mdash;"You
are more acute, Mrs. Pynsent, than myself:
you have, no doubt, excellent reasons for your
suppositions."</p>

<p>"Lord, I never suppose any thing, Lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Ennismore, or see any thing till it's all over;
only Pen's illness, just now, looks queer. If it
was not about Tom, I can't imagine the cause of
Pen's bit of a faint, just when she was to congratulate
him upon his engagement! I am sure
Pen never would faint about a trifle; and, as to
her driving, it's all my eye: my brother Bill
put her upon the coach-box as soon as she could
walk."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is mental agitation of another
kind," softly remarked Lady Ennismore.</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh!&mdash;Pen has no mental agitation,
Lady Ennismore. What should ail her to faint
about any thing, if it wasn't Tom's marriage?
My sister Hancock had always a horror of their
marrying, only I thought nothing about it.&mdash;How
was I to fancy Pen liked Tom, when she
was always with Charles Spottiswoode?"</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore appeared politely convinced,
by her companion's reasoning, that Miss Wycherly's
faintness proceeded from her cousin's
insensibility to her attachment, when the door
was thrown open to announce Lord Farnborough
and Lady Anna Herbert. Miss Wycherly
cast an eye of alarm towards the hall.
Lord Farnborough stalked majestically forward
with his daughter under his arm, and Mr. Spottiswoode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
followed too surely in their train. She
started up&mdash;"Julia, I cannot stay here; follow
me into the library."</p>

<p>Both ladies disappeared during the little bustle
of a fresh reception, and Lady Ennismore alone
observed their rapid exit. Miss Wycherly
closed the door of the library, to secure themselves
from interruption or intrusion; she then
took off her hat, and, seating herself at the
library-table, she rested her head upon her
hands, while the tears flowed copiously down
her cheeks. "Julia," she said&mdash;"Julia, I cannot
endure this; I have lost him, and my heart
will break."</p>

<p>Julia sat down opposite her companion, and
vainly offered consolation.</p>

<p>"Don't attempt to console me, Julia," sobbed
poor Miss Wycherly.</p>

<p>"I am past all consolation. The creature
has never visited Lidham since that abominable
night at Lady Spottiswoode's, and now he is
capering after Lady Anna Herbert. Oh, Julia,
if you could comprehend the misery I feel!"</p>

<p>"My dear Penelope, you never confessed
your fault to Charles Spottiswoode, I fear, by
all this grief. Have you tried to see him, or
written to him since your quarrel?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The Wycherly blood rushed into the very
forehead of Penelope. She raised her head and
dashed away the tears.</p>

<p>"Who! <i>I</i> beg submissively for Spottiswoode's
forgiveness! <i>I</i> meanly sue for pardon
to a man who has been my slave till this Lady
Anna has attracted him! <i>I</i> tell him to return
to Lidham, because I cannot live without him!
I'll die ten thousand deaths, before I will sully
my lips in imploring pardon!"</p>

<p>"But, Penelope, you are not reduced to implore
pardon," replied Julia, in soothing accents.
"You are not advised to act in any way degrading
to your feelings. Did you not trifle
most ungenerously with Mr. Spottiswoode at
your last meeting, and have you made one advance
since that time, to prove to him you were
in jest?"</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly again drooped her head upon
her hands, as she replied&mdash;"He has given me
no opportunity to do so, Julia: he has been
ever since that evening devoted to the Farnboroughs."</p>

<p>"And you have been equally devoted to the
Tyndals, Penelope. Have you not made Henry
Tyndal your shadow?"</p>

<p>"A great spoony!" ejaculated Miss Wycherly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put an end to all this," resumed Julia,
"and give Mr. Spottiswoode reason to think
you regret your unjust conduct; decline Henry
Tyndal's constant attendance, and do not bring
upon yourself the Court Herbert reproaches.
You are encouraging Henry Tyndal, Penelope,
and Mr. Spottiswoode must perceive it."</p>

<p>"I know I have done wrong, Julia, but every
thing is gone too far; I cannot, cannot subject
myself to Spottiswoode's scorn; he will never
forgive me, and I will never bear the indignity
of seeking a hopeless reconciliation. If I have
suffered Henry Tyndal's attentions, <i>he</i> has sought
Lady Anna Herbert. No, we are divided for
ever!"</p>

<p>The idea of a final separation from her lover's
affection, seemed to produce agony of mind too
powerful to endure, for, Miss Wycherly, rising
suddenly, seized Julia's hands, and gazed earnestly
in her face.</p>

<p>"Julia Wetheral, I will act upon your advice,
only tell me what to do, if any thing now
can restore his heart; I am wretched enough to
submit to any thing short of the degradation of
seeking a man's extinguished affection! You
will not wish me to do a wrong thing, Julia,
therefore, think for me, and quiet my heart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> tell you what to do, Penelope; return
with me into the drawing-room; do not
give your attention to Mr. Henry Tyndal, and
do not appear so indifferent to a man you have
driven from you with unkindness."</p>

<p>"Julia," replied Miss Wycherly, breathing
hard, "I cannot bear to see Spottiswoode with
another person. I cannot witness his attention
to Lady Anna. I will remain here till <i>they</i> are
gone, or I should die upon the spot. If you
could understand my miserable feelings, you
would pity me, and my own folly has produced
them!"</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly walked about the library in
great distress, which pierced her friend's heart
to witness. She could only offer her sympathy,
and urge her change of manners towards Mr.
Tyndal. Grief produces many effects; on some
minds the hand of sorrow falls heavily, yet it
originates patience and gentleness; in others, it
produces irritation and increased violence of
temper. It was so with Miss Wycherly, whose
spirit chafed at the remembrance of her own
folly, and even attacked the prudent counsel of
her friend.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Julia, I am ready to spurn the
Tyndals from my sight; for who can despise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
them more than I do?&mdash;but it is useless to place
before me, so pertinaciously, my folly in having
borne with them. I am well aware of my error,
without requiring any one to heap my transgressions
before my eyes at every turn. Reproach
never heals a wound."</p>

<p>"I do not speak in reproach, Penelope," replied
Julia, in accents that overcame Miss
Wycherly's quick temper; "I only point out
the means to serve you, because you asked me
to do so."</p>

<p>"Don't heed my words, Julia," exclaimed
Miss Wycherly, continuing her restless walking
up and down the library; "I speak in bitter
misery, and know not what I say. Do not leave
me, for I know you are kind, and not given to
take offence, and I am almost maddened with
vexation. Tell me what to do, Julia, and I
swear to be guided by you."</p>

<p>"I repeat my words, then, Penelope. Return
with me into the drawing-room; do not give
Mr. Henry Tyndal all your attention, and bear
with Mr. Spottiswoode's attention to Lady
Anna: it will not last long."</p>

<p>"Oh, Julia!" sighed Miss Wycherly, "if I
could but think you a true prophet&mdash;but I will
do as you wish; I will try to bear the sight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Lady Anna, but the idea gives me a shuddering
fit. See how I tremble."</p>

<p>"You do tremble, Penelope, but a determined
effort will subdue it."</p>

<p>Julia rubbed Miss Wycherly's hands, which
were deadly cold, and replaced her hat, as the
poor girl sat trembling, and incapable of assisting
herself. Julia also smoothed the curls which
fell in abundance upon her pale cheeks. "And
now, Penelope, take my arm, and let us take
one steady turn through the room, to try your
powers."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly took Julia's offered arm, and
proceeded towards the door. "Let us go into
the drawing-room at once," she said. "With
you I have given way, because I am assured of
your sympathy and secrecy; but to no other eye
will I betray my repentance or my sorrow. I
may look ill&mdash;I am ill&mdash;but no one shall say
Penelope Wycherly pines for Charles Spottiswoode."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly's sentiment operated at once
upon her nerves and manners: no one could
suppose she had just suffered a strong nervous
attack, by the collected air of her entrance again
into company. It was only the pallid complexion
and calm demeanour, which betrayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
recent illness to her friends; and Mrs. Pynsent,
satisfied that her niece could never struggle
against her disappointment with Tom, offered
her every little soothing attention, and even
seated her where she could not observe her cousin,
still conversing with Anna Maria: her chair
was placed near the window, immediately opposite
to Mr. Spottiswoode and Lady Anna Herbert.</p>

<p>"There, Pen, dear, air will refresh you; but
you have driven too far, I dare say: there, look
straight before you, and don't keep turning
round."</p>

<p>Lady Anna Herbert made a very polite speech,
hoping Miss Wycherly had not been seriously
ill, and Miss Wycherly passed through the forms
of recognition with her ladyship with great presence
of mind. Mr. Spottiswoode slightly bowed;
but he did not address her, or join in the short
conversation which ensued between the ladies.
Miss Wycherly became silent, and struggled
visibly, to Julia's eye, for resolution to bear up
through the scene. Lady Ennismore broke up
the meeting by ordering her carriage, and then
Miss Wycherly's situation became oppressive.
Tom Pynsent came forward to his cousin with
looks of interest. "Cousin Pen, I will drive
your carriage home, for Miss Julia Wetheral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
says you are not fit to hold the reins, and I think
so too."</p>

<p>Lady Spottiswoode and her daughter entreated
Miss Wycherly to suffer Mr. Pynsent to take
her place, and renounce the idea of driving.</p>

<p>"The air will revive me," said Miss Wycherly,
her lips quivering as she spoke. "I am
fatigued, I believe, and I will gladly allow Tom
to drive; but I cannot sit in the carriage. I
must be in the air."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent felt for her niece, and she resolved
to prevent her suffering the distress of
sitting a couple of hours by the side of Tom,
who was now as good as married to Miss Wetheral.
She applied to Mr. Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"Here, Charley, can't you drive the ladies
home? It's all in your way, you know, and
quite out of Tom's. Suppose you drive your
party into Shrewsbury, and Pen will drive herself
on to Lidham; the distance is a trifle from
Shrewsbury."</p>

<p>Mr. Spottiswoode expressed himself ready to
undertake the office of coachman, if Miss Wycherly
approved of his skill: Miss Wycherly caught
at this one last opportunity of seeing and speaking
to her lost lover: she rose from her chair,
and reseated herself.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall be happy if you ... yes." Not a
word more could pass her lips, though she tried
to articulate. Mr. Spottiswoode looked earnestly
at her pale countenance, and appeared struck by
her agitation. Mrs. Pynsent's heart was disturbed
by her poor niece, Pen.</p>

<p>"That arrangement will do, boys. Tom, just
shew Miss Wetheral the new picture in the
study before she goes, and Charley, Miss Wycherly's
groom will ride your horse. I shall tell
Bill Wycherly he ought to send the coachman
with Pen, not a groom-fellow."</p>

<p>Lord Farnborough and his daughter rose to
take leave. It appeared to Miss Wycherly's
jealous eye, that Lady Anna spoke laughingly to
Mr. Spottiswoode upon the subject of his new
vocation, but she could not catch the words, or
his reply: Lady Anna made her a passing bow
as she joined Lord Farnborough, and they were
gone when she passively sunk upon a sofa by
Julia's side, exhausted with her efforts. "Julia,
this day decides my destiny&mdash;I am weaker
than a child."</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Tyndal approached them to express
his regret at Miss Wycherly's fatigue:
she closed her eyes, and turned from him in disgust,
abruptly exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish to be quiet and alone, Mr. Tyndal."</p>

<p>"I am glad you are not going to drive back,"
persevered Henry Tyndal; "I dare say Spottiswoode
will drive you very well; he is a very fair
hand at the ribbons. I'm sure I would drive
you with the greatest pleasure in the world,
Miss Wycherly, but I am not a dab at driving.
I am glad, however, I shall be riding by your
carriage: you will ride inside, of course: I hope&mdash;I
beg you will ride inside."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly looked daggers at the man
with whom she had been so intimate for many
days, and whom she had allowed to be constantly
in attendance.</p>

<p>"I require no one's opinion, Mr. Tyndal, to
regulate my actions, and I shall be obliged by
your removing from before me."</p>

<p>"I am afraid Miss Wycherly is very ill," said
Henry Tyndal, looking inquisitively at Julia.
"What can we do for her, Miss Wetheral?"</p>

<p>"Do, for Heaven's sake, leave me!" cried Miss
Wycherly, losing all patience at his including
himself in her arrangements; "I will not be
annoyed by your obstinate stupidity."</p>

<p>"Stupidity, Miss Wetheral! Now what can
Miss Wycherly mean by stupidity, when I am
so fearful about her driving home?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Julia saw her friend's complexion reviving,
and her eye lighting up with a thousand fires: in
another moment, a torrent must overwhelm the
unfortunate Henry Tyndal; but, as if to prove
his utter blindness, he placed his own foot upon
the precipice by offering to take her hand. Miss
Wycherly felt the extent of her imprudence, in
suffering the attendance of a man whom she never
intended to marry, by its effects; but reason, at
that moment, did not inform her impatient spirit
that the fault was hers alone. All suggestions
of reason were overpowered by anger, for Charles
Spottiswoode's eyes were upon her, and he had
witnessed the action. Miss Wycherly pushed
Henry Tyndal's hand away, and rose from her
seat, as she replied, with great impetuosity,</p>

<p>"If you ever presume to approach me with
familiarity, I will tell you how I abhor the insolence,
and resent the affront. How dare you
attempt to touch me, Mr. Tyndal?"</p>

<p>Mr. Tyndal was offended, but he never imagined
insult and insolence could be implied in
his well-intentioned movement: he, therefore,
stood silent and sulky for a few moments. Miss
Wycherly passed him, and took her station between
Lady Spottiswoode and her aunt. Mrs.
Pynsent was pleased to perceive her son still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
absent, and her anxiety was sincere, in endeavouring
to get her niece away from Hatton, and
in preventing Tom's reappearance: she was sure
Sally Hancock would think with her that, when
once Tom was married, Pen would think no more
of the matter. Lady Ennismore's departure
destroyed all her intended plans for Penelope's
peace of mind; for Miss Wetheral was recalled
from contemplating the new picture, and where
her fairy footsteps led, there followed Tom Pynsent.
It was in vain that Mrs. Pynsent bustled
round her niece, and recommended her to Mr.
Spottiswoode's care; Tom's first step was to
bring Anna Maria up to his cousin.</p>

<p>"We have hardly spoken together, have we,
Pen, in this confounded bustle? but here's my
little wife, come to ask how you are, and to say
you must always be glad to see us at Lidham,
when you set up with you know who." Tom
looked knowingly at Henry Tyndal.</p>

<p>"We have ever been good friends, Penelope,
and a closer connexion shall not disunite us,"
said Anna Maria, as they shook hands. Tom
Pynsent, infinitely too happy to remain stationary,
walked away with his prize, and Miss
Wycherly remained with the Spottiswoodes.
Mr. Charles Spottiswoode was giving all his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
attention to some coloured prints on hunting
subjects, when Mrs. Pynsent summoned him.</p>

<p>"Here, Charley, your party are waiting for
you, and you are sitting dumb-founded, like a
lover bewitched. Pen, who do you suppose
Charley is thinking of? Who is a long way on
her road to Farnborough Stacey, Charley?"</p>

<p>Mr. Spottiswoode hastily put away the prints;
and Miss Wycherly was fast sinking into the
depression which follows effort of any kind,
when Tom Pynsent returned, in high feather,
from assisting the Wetheral party into their carriage.
He flew to Miss Wycherly.</p>

<p>"Cousin Pen, my little wife commands me to
dine at Wetheral to-day, so I shall see you properly
packed up under Spottiswoode's care: very
good thing Spottiswoode was here, or I should
have driven you home in a towering passion for
standing in my way. Come this way, Pen, my
little wife sends you a message, and so does her
sister: I must tell them as a profound secret."</p>

<p>"You be hanged, Tom, with your secret!"
said his mother, "and do not keep Pen from her
party."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent dragged Miss Wycherly into the
large bay-window, in spite of opposition.</p>

<p>"I don't understand ladies' ways just yet,
Pen, but I am ordered to say these words from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
my little wife, 'Be firm;' and her sister desired
me to say, 'All things must end well, if patient.'
Now the devil a bit can I make out any meaning
from either sentence, can you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand, Tom; and tell them this
evening for answer, 'Amen.'"</p>

<p>"You are all a parcel of riddles, Pen; what
has 'amen' to do with your affairs. I say, Pen,
what's all this with Spottiswoode?"</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly tried to answer her cousin's
question lightly, but she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho, that's it, Pen, is it?" Tom Pynsent
pronounced the words slowly, as if awakened
to some new idea gradually. "All must end
well, be firm, and amen. I see something now,
by Jove."</p>

<p>His cousin made no reply, but the tears
coursed down her cheeks. Tom Pynsent was
sorry for her, and he put his arm round her
waist, to suit the action to the word.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Pen; if you've quarrelled,
touch your swain up with a bit of sugarcandy
as you go to Shrewsbury. Pitch it in smoothly,
Pen, and Spottiswoode will turn like the sunflower.
Don't cry, cousin Pen, it makes me
dismal&mdash;d&mdash;n it, don't cry!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent underwent considerable anxiety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
during the <i>tête-à-tête</i>, but, when her son became
tender, her interference became imperative.</p>

<p>"Tommy, what are you squeezing your cousin
there about, when you are nearly married;
secrets are ill-bred things, Master Tommy."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly's distress became apparent,
and she threw open the window; her cousin
good-humouredly and awkwardly endeavoured
to conceal her from observation, by pointing out
the beauties of the view.</p>

<p>"There, Pen, are the trees I spoke of, (clear
up and dry your eyes, Pen) and my father talks
of planting upon that hill, (don't let any one
guess you are down in the mouth, Pen). I
think I like it best as it now stands. Spottiswoode,
Tyndal, give me your opinion."</p>

<p>The gentlemen were soon engaged in disputing
the propriety of planting, or not planting a
fine swell in the park, each arguing upon their
opinions, enabling Miss Wycherly to recover
some degree of composure; and, when her well-appointed
equipage drove to the door, she was
able to perform her adieus with tolerable calmness.
Tom Pynsent offered his arm to Lady
Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"Now, my lady, three gentlemen can't cut
themselves down into two, so I shall take charge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of you, while they fight for your daughter and
Pen."</p>

<p>Mr. Spottiswoode stood irresolute for an instant,
but the Mr. Tyndals took possession of
Miss Spottiswoode; neither of those gentlemen
approached Miss Wycherly. Mr. Spottiswoode
was, of course, under the necessity of leading
her to the carriage, but it took place in profound
silence. Tom Pynsent, now awake to his
cousin's state of mind, managed every thing for
her.</p>

<p>"There, ladies, you are comfortable. Pen,
let me place <i>you</i> comfortably upon your throne."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent screamed from the drawing-room
window, "I say, Tom, put Pen inside!"</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent, however, seated his cousin
safely on the "throne," as she had always designated
the coach-box, and Mr. Spottiswoode
took his seat by her side; the Mr. Tyndals also
mounted their horses, and rode away.</p>

<p>Mr. Spottiswoode paused to admit of Tom
Pynsent's careful arrangement of his cousin's
box-cloak, but Mrs. Pynsent again screamed
from the window:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, Tom, you'll be too late for Wetheral!"</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent noticed his mother's exclamations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
by a sharp movement of the elbow, and remained
till he had adjusted every thing with
precision. He then shook his cousin's hand forcibly,
and descended upon the steps of the door.
"All's right, Spottiswoode."</p>

<p>The carriage was soon lost behind the knoll,
which had been the subject of dispute.</p>

<p>The Mr. Tyndals appeared no more by the
side of the carriage, and a long silence was
broken by a remark from Mr. Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"I wonder we see nothing of the Tyndals."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly answered, half hesitating, "I
believe I have offended Mr. Henry Tyndal."</p>

<p>"That is to be regretted," was Mr. Spottiswoode's
reply, and a second silence ensued; the
remainder of the drive was passed without a
word on either side. Lady Spottiswoode urged
Miss Wycherly to remain with them and dine;
but Penelope's heart was too ill at ease to accept
her hospitality. Her pallid countenance
and hurried voice pleading excuses, spoke more
powerfully than words could do, and her friends
forbore to press her compliance. Mr. Spottiswoode
still held the reins, and evinced no intention
to quit the box. Miss Wycherly dared
not meet his eye, as she thanked him for the
trouble he had taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must not return thanks yet, for my
task is not ended," replied Mr. Spottiswoode,
"I shall drive you safely to Lidham."</p>

<p>"Pray&mdash;not for the world!" exclaimed Miss
Wycherly, fixing her eyes upon her companion,
in the energy of speaking; Mr. Spottiswoode's
face wore a mild expression, and a smile quivered
on his lip, but it fled at her exclamation, and
his manner resumed its reserve. She remembered
Julia's charge to be gentle; she remembered
her cousin's charge to "pitch it in smoothly;"
she saw also Mr. Henry Tyndal walking his
horse in the distance.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Charles Spottiswoode, drive on,
and drive fast&mdash;don't wait for any one!"</p>

<p>"Not for Tyndal?" asked Mr. Spottiswoode,
provokingly.</p>

<p>"Not for a human being&mdash;drive on, I beseech
you!"</p>

<p>Mr. Spottiswoode obeyed, and the carriage
proceeded with rapidity in the direction of Lidham.</p>

<p>Three miles were traversed, and Lidham rose
among its woods in grandeur, ere Miss Wycherly
attempted to speak; she had taxed her memory
to bring forward some topic of conversation,
but it played her false; she had awaited a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
remark from her companion, upon which to
ground her intended kindness, and it had not
reached her ear&mdash;her heart now pined to recover
its former ease and happiness, yet no opportunity
offered to attempt the resumption. To
begin the subject voluntarily, was a thought
which fled at its very birth. What! own herself
in the wrong, and apologize for having given
pain to a worthy heart? Ask for pardon, when
she had insulted a human being in the dearest
feelings? and, when her spirit longed to be at
peace with her lover, full of its own injustice and
wrong? forbid it, womanly dignity!</p>

<p>Mr. Spottiswoode passed through the lodge
at Lidham, and yet Miss Wycherly persevered
in her silence; no matter, Mr. Wycherly was
in sight, and the hour was past for repentance;
she must henceforth submit to bear a gnawing
and unpitied remorse for her levity of conduct,
and for the knowledge that she had thrown
away the very opportunity she had coveted, to
try her power upon her lover's forgiveness. To
her "dignity" she must sacrifice an ingenuous
confession of sorrow for an error, heartless as it
was uncalled for; and the demands of "dignity"
superseded the claim of right. So do women
often create their own misery, by daring to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
offend, yet quailing under the degradation of revoking
an ungenerous speech.</p>

<p>Mr. Wycherly returned to the house, and
was ready to receive his daughter and Mr. Spottiswoode
when they drove up in his usual way.
It never occurred to him that the somewhat long
absence of the latter from Lidham was a sure
prognostic of a misunderstanding between the
parties most interested in the visits.</p>

<p>"Why, Spottiswoode, you are a truant, but
Pen has caught you at last, I see. She and I
thought you were gone for ever, but I'm glad to
see you, however." Mr. Wycherly handed his
daughter from the barouche-box. "Well, now,
come down, for dinner has been ready this half-hour;
down with you, my good fellow."</p>

<p>Mr. Spottiswoode declined staying dinner;
he would take his own horse, and return to
Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>"My good fellow, what's the matter with you?
you won't think of losing your dinner? Nonsense,
my dear sir; stay and take your dinner,
and go home afterwards, if you like. Here,
Pen, try your eloquence."</p>

<p>But Miss Wycherly had flown in sorrow and
anger to her own room. Mr. Spottiswoode
perceived her departure, and it decided his own;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
he could not be prevailed upon to defer his ride
home till the evening. It was evident Miss
Wycherly got out of his way, and her manner
towards him was offensive; he could not think
of remaining at Lidham, to subject himself to
repeated annoyances; Mr. Wycherly pressed in
vain.</p>

<p>"Well, Spottiswoode, you are determined, so
I can't help it; but I think there is something
in the wind."</p>

<p>"I am returning to my mother's house," replied
Mr. Spottiswoode, as he shook hands.</p>

<p>"Give my compliments," said Mr. Wycherly,
"and tell her I say you are an obstinate mule."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>Miss Wycherly began to lose all hope of recovering
her position in Mr. Spottiswoode's
heart, unless she could prevail upon herself to
make the <i>amende honorable</i>; and to that
wretched alternative her mind would not bend.
Rather would she endure the horrible idea of
losing him; rather would she suffer the pangs of
jealousy to distract her heart, than "bow down"
before him she had offended, or say one word
which could lead him to suppose she retracted
her offensive coquetry. For some days her spirit
chafed in solitude and in silence, and Julia received
the following note, a week subsequent to
their meeting at Hatton.</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">"For Heaven's sake, Julia, come to me for
one hour, and leave Lord Ennismore behind!
Don't bring him to Lidham, for I hate the sight
and sound of lovers; come alone, and listen to
the woes of poor</p>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Penelope Wycherly</span>."<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Julia attended her summons, but Lord Ennismore
did not remain behind; he attended his
mother and his intended bride in the carriage,
and Lady Ennismore deposited Julia at Lidham,
promising to call for her on their return from
Shrewsbury. Julia found her friend pale and
ill with watching and fretting; Miss Wycherly
received her with open arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, Julia, if you knew what I have suffered
since we met last, you would pity me! I am so
glad you are come to me without your overseers!"</p>

<p>"Who are my overseers?" asked Julia, laughing
at the term.</p>

<p>"You know I must mean the Ennismores,
Julia: you are never to be seen without mother
and son. Sit down, my dear, and hear my
complaint."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly gave Julia an exact and long
statement of all that had taken place since they
had met at Hatton, and her voice became
agitated as she dwelt upon Mr. Spottiswoode's
silence during the drive, and his apparent
determination not to give her an opportunity to express
her feelings. "This, Julia, was the most
cruel part of his conduct," she continued.
"How can a woman advocate her cause, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
a man is resolved to be silent? I may have
acted wrong in the beginning, but the blame
rests with him now. I have only to be wretched
all my life, and shut myself up at Lidham."</p>

<p>Tears rushed to her eyes, but she struggled
to subdue all appearance of emotion. Julia
was preparing to speak, but a wave of the
hand deterred her.</p>

<p>"Let me say all I have to say, Julia, and
then applaud or blame me as you please. If I
was foolish to show caprice and folly at that
critical moment, Spottiswoode has exhibited
cruelty and ill-temper ever since. He knew I
meant to accept him some time or other, and he
was needlessly hasty in acting so violently and
promptly upon a nonsensical speech of mine.
Suppose every man was to fly away at a woman's
playfulness? I assure you, Julia, I was very
ill when I came from Hatton; and yet the ill-natured
creature has not inquired after me. I
think you cannot uphold such a display of
temper."</p>

<p>"I uphold Mr. Spottiswoode," replied Julia,
"upon many points, and I cannot flatter you,
Penelope, by saying you have done right in one
particular."</p>

<p>"Julia!" exclaimed Miss Wycherly, "never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
desert a friend in distress, or take a man's part
against her!"</p>

<p>"I am giving you my opinion, Penelope, and
Mr. Spottiswoode will never hear the substance
of our conversation from myself. You have
vexed and offended him; you have flirted very
publicly with Henry Tyndal; and you have
allowed Mr. Spottiswoode to imagine you have
refused himself, after allowing his attentions for
years&mdash;oh, Penelope, from your very childhood."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly coloured, and her tears began
to flow, but she made no reply. Her friend
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A woman may teaze a man who is comparatively
a stranger to her, and she may believe
herself making trial of his temper and
affection; but Mr. Spottiswoode has been born
and educated amongst us, and his attachment
has been too well known to the neighbourhood,
and to yourself, to doubt its truth. Do you
doubt his affection, Penelope?"</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly shook her head, but she did
not trust herself to speak.</p>

<p>"Then why treat him with levity, and throw
him into Lady Anna Herbert's power?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Julia!" shrieked Miss Wycherly,
as she started up from her seat, "do you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
know that for a certainty? Is he positively
thinking of Lady Anna; positively leaving me
for ever? Oh! don't in mercy tell me so!"</p>

<p>"I do not think it, Penelope, because I know
he has loved you too long to care for another;
but you have been very unkind, and it has
broken the bond of esteem between you. Take
care how you draw the reins too tightly, and
lose him past all recovery."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you are my friend, Julia," cried Miss
Wycherly, kneeling before her in agony&mdash;"if
you have any love for your playfellow in youth,
and your friend since we grew up together, act
for me in this strait, and return me Spottiswoode's
love."</p>

<p>"Then dismiss Henry Tyndal from your
constant society, Penelope."</p>

<p>"Too happy to do so, Julia!"</p>

<p>"Let Mr. Spottiswoode see by your conduct
and manners, that you regret having pained him,
Penelope."</p>

<p>"Alas! he will never give me an opportunity,
Julia."</p>

<p>"Then make one, Penelope. If you love
him as truly as you say you do, he is worth the
sacrifice of an ill-judged pride. You have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
offended him; express your regrets courageously,
and recover his esteem."</p>

<p>"I should die before the words could be
spoken, Julia," said her friend, rising from her
attitude of humility, and reseating herself.&mdash;"I
should die while I was confessing my sorrow.
Don't ask me to acknowledge error; it would be
a bitter task, and I never can sue for a husband&mdash;no,
that I never, never can do."</p>

<p>"My dear Penelope...."</p>

<p>"Think of any other way, Julia, but not that
dreadfully degrading task of imploring pardon&mdash;of
bowing down before an offended lover! I
should never again be able to assert my power!"</p>

<p>"We see things very differently, Penelope.
Remember the extremely keen feelings of Mr.
Spottiswoode, and the pain he has suffered in
your flirtation with Henry Tyndal!"</p>

<p>"He has brought it upon himself."</p>

<p>"And you are content to resign Mr. Spottiswoode
for the indulgence of false pride, Penelope&mdash;to
lose the affection of a kind, constant
lover, because you cannot condescend to say you
were wrong! Then Lady Anna will be a happy
woman if she can succeed you."</p>

<p>"You drive me wild with naming Lady
Anna!" cried Miss Wycherly. "No one shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
succeed me in Charles Spottiswoode's heart,
or I'll not stay at Lidham to see it. I believe
I am proud, Julia, too proud for my peace of
mind, but I shall never conquer it; it will drive
me to my grave."</p>

<p>"Struggle against such an ignoble passion,
Penelope."</p>

<p>Mr. Wycherly's voice resounded through the
hall, calling for his daughter. "I say Pen!&mdash;here!
halloo, Pen!"</p>

<p>"I cannot meet him with these red eyes,"
hastily observed Miss Wycherly. "My dear
dear Julia, do speak for me!"</p>

<p>Julia joined Mr. Wycherly in the hall, who
politely apologised for his vociferation; he was
not aware of her presence at Lidham; he was
only calling on Pen, to order some bread and
cheese for Spottiswoode, and one or two hungry
dogs, who would not dismount; but the servants
were gone for the refreshments, and he would
not detain her, or tease Pen, who was any thing
but well.</p>

<p>"If Mr. Spottiswoode is at the hall-door,
I should like much to see him for a few moments,"
was Julia's observation.</p>

<p>"He is here, and Tyndal, father and son. I
can't get any of them to dismount; when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
see you, Miss Julia, one or two may change
their mind, and prefer eating in-doors. I'll tell
Spottiswoode you are here; or if you take my
arm and show yourself, the effect will be greater."</p>

<p>Julia accompanied Mr. Wycherly to the
door, and, after a few general compliments
had passed, she addressed herself particularly
to Mr. Spottiswoode, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Mr. Spottiswoode, I wish to speak with you;
can you leave your party?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; I shall feel honoured by any command
from you." Mr. Spottiswoode dismounted,
and gave his horse to one of the Lidham
grooms.</p>

<p>"There!" cried Mr. Wycherly. "I told
you so, Miss Julia, I told you what would
happen, didn't I? Tyndal is good for nothing,
but his son will follow the lead."</p>

<p>It was Mr. John Tyndal who accompanied
his father, and they were not able to accept
the tempting invitation&mdash;"they would just take
a hurried snack upon their horses, and proceed;
would Wycherly join them?"</p>

<p>"And leave Spottiswoode to the ladies' care?"</p>

<p>"To be sure; Spottiswoode was a lady's
man, and they were always petted animals."</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Julia," said Mr. Wycherly, "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
give Spottiswoode into your hands, and you are
responsible for consequences. Pen and you will
entertain him as long as he behaves well."</p>

<p>Julia promised to be his guardian angel, and
she proceeded with Mr. Spottiswoode to the
sitting-room, where Miss Wycherly was lying
extended upon the sofa, thoughtful and hopeless
of ever seeing happy days again, if they were to
be purchased by her own submission. She rose
slowly as the door opened.</p>

<p>"What a time you have been flirting with
papa, Julia!" she exclaimed, reproachfully. At
that moment she perceived Mr. Spottiswoode,
and a cry of surprise burst from her lips, but
she did not advance to receive him. Mr. Spottiswoode
stood near the door, and, resenting the
coldness of his reception, he spoke only to Julia.</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral, you wished to speak with
me; may I beg the favour of your communication?"</p>

<p>"It is comprised in few words, Mr. Spottiswoode.
My friend Penelope is distressed and
grieved at having given you unprovoked offence,
and she pines to recover your esteem."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;it is not true!" shrieked Miss
Wycherly, hiding her face among the sofa
pillows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Spottiswoode," continued Julia, "you
are both unhappy, and this misunderstanding
will never end without the assistance of a mutual
friend. I now tell you, Penelope regrets her
error, but fears to lessen herself in your opinion,
by doing justice to herself and you. She is
miserable at having quarrelled, and why should
you not know it, and be friends?"</p>

<p>"By my soul, Penelope, I forgive the pain
you have caused me," said Mr. Spottiswoode,
approaching her, "if I may indeed believe you
repent your unkind treatment."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly shrunk from his touch as her
lover offered to take her hand.</p>

<p>"I do not repent&mdash;I regret nothing&mdash;oh,
Julia! was this kind to betray me! I will
never believe you could love me, and yet have
done this!" She rose to fly from the room, but
Mr. Spottiswoode's arm, gently wound round her
waist, arrested her flight.</p>

<p>"Stay, Penelope, and tell me why you avoid
a man who loves you, and has borne what I
have done for you? Tell me why you fear to
say a kind thing, when it may balance a
thousand harsh ones? Why must you distress
a heart which never gave <i>you</i> uneasiness?"</p>

<p>"You have made me uneasy enough with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
your attention to Lady Anna," replied Miss
Wycherly, earnestly, yet not attempting to disengage
herself.</p>

<p>"Do you seriously mean that, Penelope?"
said Mr. Spottiswoode, looking inquiringly into
her face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do: your flirtation there was worse
than mine with Henry Tyndal; every body
knew <i>he</i> was not cared for, but <i>you</i> were
abominable."</p>

<p>"Look me in the face, Penelope, and say
that again if you dare."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly did not repeat the accusation:
how could she? Her lover held her to
his heart, and every disquieting thought was
stilled. She turned to Julia, and held out her
hand.</p>

<p>"Julia, I will never forget that you brought
about this reconciliation. I was too proud to
own myself in fault, and had you not interfered,
we should never have met again in harmony.
I was agonised at first with anger, but it is past
now; and, for Heaven's sake, don't let us quarrel
again, Charles Spottiswoode!"</p>

<p>"Then you will have me without another interview
with Captain Jekyl, Penelope?"</p>

<p>"Don't remember all that nonsense."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will not. Miss Wetheral, I am deeply
obliged to you for your spirited and friendly conduct
to us both. Had it not been for your intervention,
I should not have entered Lidham
again. Our mutual obligations, Penelope, are
great to this excellent friend."</p>

<p>"When Julia wants a home or a friend, she
will remember Lidham, Charles."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Julia, smiling; "should
such a time ever arrive, I will appear before you,
to seek my home of rest."</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore's carriage was announced,
and Julia rose to depart. "I have done an
action which will always give me pleasure to
contemplate," she said, as she shook hands with
the reconciled pair. "I have linked the chain
round my two friends, and it shall not break
again. Penelope, I bespeak you upon a certain
occasion; you must follow me to the altar when
my hour comes."</p>

<p>"I will follow you to the death, my dear,"
replied her friend, "to the altar, to wealth, to
misery, or the grave."</p>

<p>"Nay, only to the altar, Penelope; I will
give you due notice."</p>

<p>Mr. Spottiswoode led her to the carriage, and
repeated his acknowledgments. Lord Ennismore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
received her, and Julia left Lidham again,
in company with those whom Miss Wycherly
termed her overseers.</p>

<p>Wetheral Castle was now the scene of considerable
bustle and gaiety. Lady Wetheral
was destined, apparently, to succeed in every
wish of her heart, for she had arranged and contrived
to execute her plan of marrying both
daughters on the same day. The Boscawens
were invited to attend their nuptials; and Lady
Ennismore, Mrs. Pynsent, and Lady Wetheral,
united in wishing the day to be an early one.
Lady Ennismore spoke in terms of elegant compliment,
and expressed her maternal anxiety to
see her son happily settled ere she retired to her
seat in Lincolnshire; but Mrs. Pynsent did not
attempt to press flowers of eloquence into her
oratory.</p>

<p>"Here, let's have no dawdling, but let Tom
get married; what's the use of kicking our heels
here doing nothing? I'm for setting smartly to
work, and naming a day. Come, this day three
weeks I'll say, and Tom will back me."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral saw every thing could safely
be left to Mrs. Pynsent's care, as far as the time
was concerned; she, therefore, gave her attention
to ornamental attire, and complimented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Mrs. Pynsent by placing the day at her disposal.
Mrs. Pynsent decided at once.</p>

<p>"Well then, I say this day three weeks, and
no putting off."</p>

<p>From that hour, all was movement and consultation:
Lady Ennismore and her son returned
to Bedinfield to prepare for the bride's
reception, and they were to reappear at Wetheral
the week of the nuptials. Every body was to
be congregated at Wetheral on the Monday
preceding the ceremony, but the Boscawens
were to spend a fortnight there, as Isabel would
enjoy the sight of bridal finery.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral received Isabel with all the
honours due to her position in society. Anna
Maria and Julia's future exaltation must place
them beyond Isabel in pomp and circumstance;
but still Mrs. Boscawen held a decided station,
and she was mistress of Brierly. Mrs. Boscawen
was therefore received at Wetheral with much
ceremony and polite welcome. Isabel, however,
returned to her early home a changed being:
the light-hearted girl who had quitted Wetheral
scarcely a twelvemonth, in smiles and joyous
anticipations, returned a matron in appearance,
grave and subdued in manner, and apparently
frightened into stillness by her husband's stern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
observation. She was no longer the sprightly,
happy, madcap Isabel Wetheral; her laugh
had fled, and even the smiles which used to pass
in rapid succession over her bright face, stole
now upon her lips slow and seldom. Her
mother complimented Isabel upon the change
so rapid and so complete.</p>

<p>"I am never weary admiring you, my dear
Mrs. Boscawen; and I little imagined my romping
daughter would be so soon transferred into
an elegant, quiet matron. Your manners are
quite perfect, my love."</p>

<p>A placid smile curled the lip of Isabel at this
compliment.</p>

<p>"I am very quiet now, I believe; Mr. Boscawen
dislikes laughing."</p>

<p>"It is not an accomplishment," said Lady
Wetheral; "every common creature can laugh.
I believe the loudest laughter is considered the
pleasantest person among the commonality. I
detest a laugher."</p>

<p>"I enjoyed laughing extremely," replied
Isabel, with a sigh. "I should like to laugh
again, but there is nothing laughable at Brierly.
Mr. Boscawen does not like young people staying
in the house, and I have mixed entirely
among old people since I married."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your situation, my love! Mr. Boscawen is
anxious to keep you quiet, I dare say."</p>

<p>"I should prefer having a friend or two with
me to enliven Brierly," returned Isabel, gravely.
"Mr. Boscawen liked to see me merry before
we married, but now he says it is wrong. I
think my sisters are foolish to marry. Anna
Maria, you had better remain single, for Mr.
Boscawen says young married women should not
appear lively and ready to chat with gentlemen,
and you know we chatted away here."</p>

<p>"Mr. Boscawen is elderly, my love; elderly
gentlemen are very particular," observed Lady
Wetheral, soothingly.</p>

<p>"Old or young, they are much the same, I
believe; my jokes amused Mr. Boscawen extremely
till I married. Papa always liked to
see me happy, too; Mr. Boscawen's sister, Tabitha,
reads such lectures if I laugh! I don't
like her at all."</p>

<p>"I think you look extremely handsome and
well, Mrs. Boscawen. Matrimony has improved
you&mdash;confinement in two months time, you say?
I wish I could offer you my assistance, my love;
but you know what a poor nervous creature I am."</p>

<p>"Mr. Boscawen says I am only to have his
sister Tabitha with me."</p>

<p>"An excellent arrangement, my love. Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Tabitha will not have the anxiety which would
make <i>me</i> worse than useless. I dare say she is
a steady sort of person."</p>

<p>"I don't like her at all, mamma; I would
rather have you at Brierly."</p>

<p>"Me, my love! Oh, no! I am too nervous,
not half so fitted for the department of nurse as
good Miss Tabitha. Those old maids, you know,
are calm and useful in their ignorance. I should
be nervous, and make you so; Boscawen has
arranged very prudently."</p>

<p>Isabel privately confessed to her sisters that
if she had only suspected what her matrimony
was to end in, nothing should have induced
her to marry. That beautiful cloak with the
leopard's claw had been of no use; not once
had she occasion to wear it. Boscawen made
her read history for some hours every day, which
she forgot as soon as she closed the books; then
Boscawen worried her with lessons of geography,
and expected her to understand accounts, and
comprehend housekeeping&mdash;a thing she detested;
perhaps when she became a mother, she might
have more power, but at present she was neither
more nor less than a girl at school.</p>

<p>Isabel took great notice of Christobelle; and
while her elder sisters were absorbed in preparation
for their approaching nuptials, she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
her companion at all hours; and she loved to
have her youngest sister constantly at her side.
Mr. Boscawen freely indulged his lady in her
love for Christobelle's society, and expressed himself
pleased by her selection.</p>

<p>"I can have no objection, Isabel, to your
youngest sister being with you, and if you can
obtain your father's consent, you can take her
to Brierly. I like her turn for reading; you
can read together. I do not wish you to be
mixed up with the foolish preparations going on
among your sisters and mother&mdash;jewels and
dresses, all nonsense. I wish you to attend
particularly to history, that you may not be wanting
in necessary information; and I expect your
mornings will be devoted to study, as usual.
Your youngest sister can be with you, and your
studies may proceed together."</p>

<p>"I thought this fortnight was to be a holiday,
Mr. Boscawen," said Isabel, mournfully.</p>

<p>"My dear Isabel, you have much to make up,
and at your age much is acquired. I was distressed
at hearing you assert to my sister a short
time since, that you could reach France by land."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Boscawen, I did not know to the
contrary."</p>

<p>"But you ought to know, my dear Isabel;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
an ignorant woman at the head of a man's table
is terrible. I am continually watching to repair
your blunders."</p>

<p>"I made no blunders before I married, Mr.
Boscawen."</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen gave a grim smile at Isabel's
assertion, and patted her shoulder with kind
feeling.</p>

<p>"Yes, you did, and those blunders amused
me; but, my dear Isabel, a lover is charmed
with faults and blunders, which make a husband
miserable, so read and improve yourself in knowledge.
Chrystal is the best companion for you at
Wetheral." In consequence of Mr. Boscawen's
wish, Isabel and Christobelle studied together,
and the child of ten years of age was even better
acquainted with the elements of knowledge than
the woman of eighteen. Isabel had an insuperable
objection to study of any kind, and when
Mr. Boscawen left the sisters together for an
hour, Isabel quitted her dull history to seize upon
Christobelle's little collection of story-books,
or else she vented her disappointed feelings in
warning her never to marry at all, but particularly
an old man. It was all vanity and vexation
of spirit; she had never seen company at
Brierly; and Mr. Boscawen determined to receive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
none till she could conduct her own establishment;
that time would never arrive, for she
never could order any thing but mutton-chops
and mashed potatoes. And Miss Tabitha
scolded and lectured in vain. However, Mr.
Boscawen said she might have Christobelle with
her, and that was a blessing; for when she came,
she might get out a little more.</p>

<p>Such was Isabel's course of life, after marrying
precisely to have uncontrolled liberty, to
ride all day in the gig, and fill Brierly as full as
it could hold.</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent was very indignant at Isabel's
mode of life. "What the devil did a man
marry for, if a wife was only to be turned into a
daughter? and what was a woman the better for
having her head crammed with knowledge. For
his part, he hoped Anna Maria could not tell
great A from a bull's foot, and she would get no
teaching at Hatton."</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen persevered in his system, and
only smiled grimly at the observations which
were showered in his presence. No sort of excuse,
no little morning gaiety, was allowed to
prevail with him in liberating his wife from her
course of study. Till four in the afternoon,
Isabel was toiling at the arts and sciences; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
at that hour her husband took her an airing in the
carriage which had so delighted her sight on her
wedding-day:&mdash;she called it now her prison-house.</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen's system of education, however
unpalatable it proved to Isabel's taste, was one
of gentleness, and of great importance to her
mind. He was never harsh in his observations,
and he bore with great patience his young wife's
disinclination to improve her resources. Nothing
could be more agreeably explained than Mr.
Boscawen's views upon every subject. He imparted
instruction so mildly, and varied his
course of studies so insinuatingly, that the mornings
flew past in really instructive yet pleasing
pursuits.</p>

<p>At Christobelle's young age, she delighted in
Mr. Boscawen's gentle administration, and no
one ever before had power to withdraw her from
her father's study. During Isabel's visit, Christobelle
lived in her dressing-room; and when Mr.
Boscawen walked out, Christobelle hovered round
him, and listened to his kindly-expressed sentiments
upon every trifle which she offered to his
notice. Mr. Boscawen possessed but two failings;
he had a most repulsive expression of
countenance; and he married a young, laughing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
girl, hardly out of the nursery, who could not
appreciate his extensive knowledge, and who
could never prove the companion his intellectual
taste coveted. Caught by the vivacity and
beauty of a sprightly girl, he had vainly promised
himself pleasure in superintending her
education, and in leading her talents towards
the stores which learning could bestow: mortification
was the result of his anxiety.</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen was not the first wise man who
fell in love, and fancied he could make a young
creature happy, by endeavouring to raise her
capacity to his own level. Many have tried the
experiment and failed, because they would not
believe the sparkling eye could emanate from gay
spirits unconnected with scope of intellect, and
because they expected that age and gravity could
assimilate with youthful feelings and youthful
views. Isabel was not adapted to the sameness
of her life at Brierly: had she married a man
more suited to her time of life, her joyous spirit
would have met the cares of this world with light-heartedness
and in smiles; but the awful countenance
of her husband ever resting upon her&mdash;his
perpetual anxiety respecting her manners&mdash;his
remarks, so gentle yet so sternly spoken&mdash;all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
pressed upon her mind, and weighed down her
spirits.</p>

<p>Whenever Isabel spoke, her eye rested with
alarm upon Mr. Boscawen; and it was evident
she had been tutored into some degree of caution,
by the unwearied lectures of Miss Tabitha
Boscawen, upon the necessity of married ladies
thinking before they spoke upon any subject.
Lady Wetheral was enthusiastic in her praise of
Isabel's improved appearance and manner, but
her sisters and Miss Wycherly mourned over the
change which had taken place. Miss Wycherly
spoke openly her opinion.</p>

<p>"I declare, and I always did declare, it was
a sinful act to give Isabel to that lanky, dark,
awful Mr. Boscawen. The poor thing was not
able to judge for herself, and she fancied every
elderly man was like her father. I think such
very unnatural matches should be prevented by
act of parliament."</p>

<p>Isabel one morning stole away from her heavy
volume of Rapin, to look over the wardrobe of
the two brides, which had arrived from town,
and were hung in magnificent array in their
apartments. Miss Wycherly and Miss Spottiswoode
were also sitting in judgment upon their
beauty of make and material, and the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
female population of Wetheral were admitted
to admire and wonder over the costly arrangement.
Isabel's eyes sparkled at the sight, and,
with true girlish delight, she examined and
applauded each article as it attracted her notice.</p>

<p>"Oh, Julia, this satin is yours, I am sure!
Yes, that is Lady Ennismore at a first glance;
how very beautiful! Ah, Julia! I hope you will
wear it oftener than I have worn my pretty blue
silk: I shall wear it on your wedding-day, and
that will be only the second time of its appearance
upon any stage. I dare say it will look
old-fashioned now compared to yours. One
small flounce, you see&mdash;how pretty! my blue
silk has no flounce." She passed on to the case
which contained the jewels presented to Julia
by Lady Ennismore.</p>

<p>"Well, Julia, this <i>is</i> a sight! how very
sparkling and brilliant! I wonder how often
you will wear them? Mr. Boscawen does not
like me to wear the beautiful brooch papa gave
me; he says it is attending to the outside of the
platter instead of the inside, and then he said
something in Greek or French, I don't know
which; but my poor ornament was laid up in
silver paper again. I hope Lord Ennismore will
let you dress handsomely, Julia."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never cared much about dress, Isabel,"
said Julia; "if dear Augustus dislikes dress, I
shall renounce it very willingly."</p>

<p>"Would you, indeed? Ah! but you are
very fond of Lord Ennismore, and he likes every
thing you do and say: so did Mr. Boscawen
once. Oh, Anna Maria, this muslin dress,
worked so divinely! One comfort is, Tom Pynsent
will let you wear muslin and satin by day
and by night, if you choose to do so. Lord
Ennismore I know nothing about, but I <i>do</i> know
my old partner Tom's good-nature. How I
wish Mr. Boscawen was like Tom Pynsent!
Mr. Boscawen is very kind, though: I am sure
he never contradicts me in any thing, but he
talks me into his measures, which is just the
same thing. I never could argue; and if I did,
Mr. Boscawen talks so many languages, I could
never argue against them all. How I have been
talking!&mdash;I could almost fancy myself unmarried.
What was that?&mdash;a bell? I must run away, or
Mr. Boscawen will find me a truant when he
returns."</p>

<p>"See here, Isabel," exclaimed Miss Wycherly&mdash;"here
is a poplin sweetly trimmed; don't
run away!"</p>

<p>"My dear, I must; don't tempt me; I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
sure that was Mr. Boscawen's bell, to ask where
I was. It is airing time, and I dare say my
prison-house is at the door."</p>

<p>Away flew Isabel, in alarm, lest her husband
should have perceived her flight from the dressing-room.</p>

<p>"Delightful specimen of matrimony!" observed
Miss Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"It is not a comfortable view of the state,"
replied Miss Wycherly; "but Isabel and Mr.
Boscawen were never intended to become man
and wife. It has been one of those unaccountable
proceedings which do sometimes occur, and
which causes misery to two very excellent people.
Either would have been happy in a different
connexion: I think Isabel ought to have married
John Tyndal."</p>

<p>"And why John Tyndal?" asked Miss Spottiswoode,
hastily.</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly smiled. "Only, if it had so
happened, Sophy, John Tyndal's good-nature
would have given way to Isabel's tastes."</p>

<p>"He is the soul of good-nature and kindness,"
replied Miss Spottiswoode, "yet he might not
have been happy with Isabel."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, if he liked another lady better;
but don't blush, Sophy. I have offended his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
brother for ever; Henry Tyndal meets me now,
and will not see me, or bow as we pass."</p>

<p>"Because you behaved very ill to him, and
Charles too, Penelope."</p>

<p>"Well, now, Sophy, that is past and forgiven,
so let us think of the girls' wedding-clothes, and
all the bustle of this day week."</p>

<p>The ladies again proceeded to comment upon
the beauty of the dresses, and all subjects gave
way to the engrossing topic of dress and jewels.</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent was firmly decided not to accept
his father's resignation of Hatton upon his
marriage; and Sir John Wetheral upheld him
in his resolution. Lady Wetheral lost all patience
with such determinations.</p>

<p>"I am sure, Sir John, the Pynsents are anxious
to leave Hatton, and relinquish the trouble
of superintending such large property. How
much happier old Mr. Pynsent will be in some
quiet nook, enjoying himself, if you did not fancy
such foolish schemes, and innoculate Tom with
the disease! I wonder, my dear Mr. Boscawen,
you do not urge Sir John to allow Mr. Pynsent
his own way in this matter."</p>

<p>"<i>Aparte mala cum est mulier, tum damum est
bona</i>," said Mr. Boscawen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"You agree with me? Is that your meaning
when translated?"</p>

<p>"I do not," replied Mr. Boscawen, mildly;
"I give my judgment entirely in favour of Tom
Pynsent."</p>

<p>"You have not given the subject your best
consideration, my love," observed her husband.</p>

<p>"The thing requires no consideration, Sir
John: you are traversing Mr. Pynsent in his
wishes, and preparing severe pain for me. I always
hoped and believed Anna Maria would be
near me, and you are endeavouring to banish her
the county. I confess I am ill prepared for this
blow, Sir John Wetheral, and I hope I shall not
be extremely ill from the shock."</p>

<p>Sir John endeavoured to explain away his
lady's objections to the present arrangement;
but her mind was totally overpowered by the
reflection that Hatton must not yet shelter his
daughter.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, Sir John. Nothing
can explain away my distress at perceiving you
determined to expel my daughter from Hatton,
and I can only appeal to Tom Pynsent from your
harsh resolution. I shall implore him to let my
daughter be near her mother."</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent's mind was composed of kindly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
materials, but his perceptions of right were always
clear, and his conduct did credit to those
perceptions, by resisting, formidably and
pertinaciously, every attempt to attract him from the
path chalked out by his straightforward, well-judging
principles. Lady Wetheral's eloquent
and parental complainings roused his best feelings,
but Tom Pynsent was at this moment, as
he ever had been, perfectly blind to all hints and
concealed purposes. He read her ladyship's
meaning, simply as a parent mourning her separation
from a loved and gentle daughter, and his
excellent heart prompted every means of consolation.</p>

<p>"God bless my soul, Lady Wetheral, I feel
quite a brute in taking Anna Maria out of the
neighbourhood, while you suffer so much&mdash;I am
sure I am willing to do any thing to lessen your
regret! Anna Maria, my dear little duck, what
shall we do for Lady Wetheral?"</p>

<p>"To be separated from two daughters at once,"
remarked Lady Wetheral, despairingly&mdash;"to lose
two children at once is a serious misery. Julia <i>must</i>
live in Staffordshire&mdash;she must, and, of course,
ought, to settle upon her husband's property:
but my dearest Anna Maria need not surely
desert us!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll decide upon at once,"
cried Tom Pynsent.</p>

<p>Her ladyship listened with intense eagerness.</p>

<p>"I'll decide at once, and accept my father's
offer to live&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral seized Tom Pynsent's large
red hand. "You have given peace to my heart,
Tom, to a mother's deep disquietude&mdash;I understand
you&mdash;my Anna Maria will live near me.
You will be brilliant, as I anticipated, my dear
girl!"</p>

<p>"I'll do what I never thought I could do,"
continued Tom Pynsent; "but I am sure I'll
not separate you from your daughter, if you love
her as well as I do. Come, then, I'll accept my
father's offer of a large house in Dog Pole; and
though I never lived in a town, I'll do it to quiet
your heart, Lady Wetheral."</p>

<p>Her ladyship sunk into a chair&mdash;she could
only articulate, faintly, "Oh&mdash;no, no!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I will, though, Lady Wetheral.
I'll remove the kennel to Coleham, and then
I can hunt; I'll amuse myself on Sundays
with shewing my wife the hounds, and I must
patronise the poor devils of players in an evening,
to amuse my little woman here. I will do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
it, upon my soul: I'm not joking, Lady Wetheral."</p>

<p>"No, it cannot be&mdash;I see it is wrong&mdash;no,
you shall not live in Shrewsbury to please <i>me</i>,"
said her ladyship, writhing in horror; "my
daughter would become ill in a close atmosphere.
You would become disgusted too. I see very
clearly my mistake&mdash;no, that must not be. A
little effort will shake off maternal regrets."
Lady Wetheral trembled with the remembrance
even of Tom Pynsent's offer. Her daughter
living in Dog Pole, and going to the play like a
mechanic's wife!&mdash;oh, let her die first! She
was obliged to have recourse to her salts.</p>

<p>Anna Maria was surprised at the strong emotion
which seized upon her mother. She offered
consolation in her own way.</p>

<p>"But, mamma, if you are so distressed at our
leaving you, I beseech you to postpone my marriage
for a short time, till the remembrance of
Julia has subsided. I cannot bear to see you
suffer, mamma. Let my marriage be suspended
a fortnight&mdash;I know Tom will accede for my
sake, won't you, dear Tom?"</p>

<p>"I would rather live in Dog Pole than postpone
my marriage," answered Tom Pynsent,
sturdily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Neither, neither," said Lady Wetheral,
rising; "I will not hear of any change. I am
foolish in my fondness, but I must have fortitude,
like other mothers. I must remember
I have Clara and poor little Chrystal to comfort
me. Decide upon your place of residence, and
so it is not a town or a village, I shall be
satisfied."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral quitted the room in a state of
mind most pitiable; she had been foiled in her
wish to see Anna Maria placed immediately at
the head of the Hatton establishment, and, this
one wish disappointed, she felt as though every
other gratified vision of grandeur sank into
nothingness; one defeat obliterated a thousand
victories; such is the nature of a mind unaccustomed
to meet impediments in its rapid course.</p>

<p>"Tom!" said his fair <i>fiancée</i>, as the door
closed upon them, "I am going to wish a wish."</p>

<p>"You wished a pretty wish, just now, you
little rascal, didn't you?" answered her lover,
throwing his arm round Anna Maria, and squeezing
her till she exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, for Heaven's sake, Tom! your arm is
like a steam-engine in full play!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am rough," said Tom, anxiously
rubbing the arm which had been pinioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
to her side by his embrace, "but I am an awkward
dog by nature. Come, what is your wish,
and you shall have it; but, no more putting off
the wedding-day, mind."</p>

<p>"I should like, Tom, to go to Paris."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" ejaculated Tom Pynsent, in
extremity of astonishment, "by all the saints
and holy women, what are we to do at Paris,
my darling girl?"</p>

<p>"Just to see Paris, my dear Tom, and pass a
few weeks there."</p>

<p>"I think I see myself in Paris, d&mdash;n me!"
cried her lover, excited something beyond his
usual subdued language in Anna Maria's presence:
"the Frenchmen will hoot me through
the streets; why, we can't manage a sentence
in French between us!"</p>

<p>"We can hire somebody to speak for us, dear
Tom, and every one speaks French now, except
ourselves. I want to see Paris, and Blucher,
and, what can it signify, whether we speak English
or French?"</p>

<p>"How shall we eat their infernal frogs and
garlic, Anna Maria?" asked Tom Pynsent, with
a shudder, "and, what shall we do in a great
city, without knowing their jargon? My dear
girl, we shall be like the babes in the wood!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no, Tom, we shall get on like other
people, and Sir John Spottiswoode delights in
Paris; he wishes his mother and sister to join
him, Penelope says. We shall find him out;
and, then if you dislike Paris, we can return
home, you know."</p>

<p>"I never was at sea in my life, Anna Maria;
I never was even upon the Severn. Deuce take
it, I shall be like the hounds at fault, and you,
my poor girl, will want to get back to Shropshire."</p>

<p>"No, I shall not," said Miss Wetheral;
"say, Tom, you will take me to Paris!"</p>

<p>"I'll take you to the world's end, my darling,
if you fancy it; how is this little arm? I'm not
fit to take charge of a creature like you, with
my rough ways, but you shall have all your little
whims gratified."</p>

<p>Thus, then, was a visit to Paris decided upon;
and Tom Pynsent renouncing his country, and
truly English tastes, gave way at once to Anna
Maria's wishes, and commenced preparations for
a foreign expedition. Certainly no character
possessed more real kindness, than the unselfish
and affectionate Tom Pynsent, for, of all men
upon earth, he was the least calculated, in taste
and habits, to relish even a temporary banishment
from his native land.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>There was wassail in Wetheral Castle previous
to the nuptials; a scene of gaiety repugnant
to Sir John's ideas of propriety, but which
was not checked by the simple expression of his
wishes. In vain he remonstrated against the
levity which surrounded him; in vain he disapproved
of the course of dinner-parties which preceded
so immediately an event of deep importance
to the happiness of two children. His
lady protested the "proprieties" were not infringed
by a house full of company.</p>

<p>"If, Sir John, your daughters were on the
eve of marriage with plebeian men of wealth, or
had they chosen to select professional men, or
even men of inferior weight in their respective
counties, I grant you it would be an unnecessary
display; in the present case, the neighbourhood
expect a gaiety, which throws a sort of halo
round the approaching event. One daughter,
love, becomes a countess on Thursday next, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
one daughter weds the finest property in Shropshire.
I wonder you do not exult with me! I
have been complimented with burning hearts, I
am sure, by all my married friends, and, as Lady
Farnborough said yesterday very truly, I have
monopolized the first matches in the counties of
Salop and Staffordshire. I am aware I have
done so; I am aware I have taken great pains
to promote my children's welfare. I may say,
too, Julia's match was exclusively my own, in
its invention and maturity."</p>

<p>"My dear Gertrude," replied Sir John,
calmly, "I am satisfied if my girls are marrying
according to their own satisfaction, as far as regards
themselves; but I cannot exult in losing
two members of my family, when I strongly
doubt the happiness of one of them."</p>

<p>"My dear love! you have the oddest notions!
but you were always unaccountable. I
am proud to receive the congratulations of my
friends. I wish Anna Maria had persuaded Tom
to remain at Hatton, when it was first named,
for old Pynsent may live these twenty years!
However, since Hatton is out of the question, I
am glad they are going abroad. I should not
like Anna Maria placed in any situation less
magnificent than Hatton, and people of distinction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
crowd to Paris now, to see the allied sovereigns.
Tom has bought a very handsome travelling
chariot; his appointments will be perfect."</p>

<p>"I should think, Gertrude, less bustle would
be more agreeable to you, on the eve of parting
with your daughter for twelve months."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral sighed. "A little amusement,
perhaps, is useful in softening my regrets,
and Mrs. Boscawen, poor child, is so delighted
with the entertainments! How Mr. Boscawen
has managed, I cannot imagine; <i>I</i> never could
silence Isabel, but he has succeeded; and Isabel
is really a little star now in society. <i>I</i> had
quite given her up. Mrs. Boscawen, poor child,
was in ecstacies over her sisters' wardrobes.
They have jewels which a crowned head might
prize, certainly; whereas, Boscawen gave Isabel
nothing. I confess I do sometimes feel indignant
that the Lady of Brierly is so very simply
dressed, but I never liked Boscawen's temper."</p>

<p>"He considers Isabel too young to indulge
in folly, my dear Gertrude."</p>

<p>"Temper, all temper," returned her ladyship;
"an old man marrying a young wife, should
consider <i>her</i> tastes and <i>her</i> wishes. What did
Isabel become Mrs. Boscawen for, but to command
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
advantages, and surround herself with
comforts?"</p>

<p>"Then Isabel must learn by experience the
wickedness of sacrificing herself to mercenary
views. Chrystal," continued Sir John, addressing
himself to his youngest child, with earnestness
of voice and manner, "your education
was made over to my care. Never let your
mind rest upon the follies which women delight
to enjoy at the expense of happiness and
respectability. Let your wishes, my child, rest upon
better and nobler views; and advise your elder
sisters, when they perceive the fallacy of hunting
after useless pleasures, to turn aside from ambition,
and think what a bitter draught has been
presented to their lips."</p>

<p>"My dear love, a perfect homily!" exclaimed
his lady, smiling, "and my youngest daughter's
very unpronounceable name will be less disagreeable
than her temper, if she is to preach to
her family upon your recommendation. I am
quite amused by your humility, considering the
splendid matches your daughters have made. I
am not so gifted with humble feelings; I am
silly enough to rejoice in their welfare. The
Kerrisons, my love, dine with us to-day. Sir
Foster and myself are almost lovers; I am delighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
with his sentiments&mdash;most excellent
man! I told him he must allow us to run away
with his pretty daughter for a few weeks, after
my dear girls are gone to their new homes.
Clara and you, Chrystal, will miss your sisters.
I shall be very low myself. Dear girls! I told
Sir Foster, Miss Kerrison's lively spirits would
be of so much benefit to us! He seemed flattered,
I thought, by my remark, and gave such
a polite bow of acquiescence! Sir Foster is
really a gentleman of the old school; a picture
quite."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral became loquacious in praise
of Sir Foster; and in her fulness of commendation,
the purpose of her heart betrayed itself.</p>

<p>"I am so provoked when I hear people repeating
all the idle reports which emanate from
discharged grooms, and low servants. Just the
very class of society who deal so largely in ungrateful
abuse. I can gather from Sir Foster's
sentiments, how gentle his nature must be, and
his large family, I am sure, are excellently managed.
Such order and economy in every department!
I judge, of course, from fountainhead
particulars, for Sir Foster and myself
talked a great deal upon the subject at Hatton
yesterday, I told him his daughter would improve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
my Clara in matters of economy; her
ideas, I said, were at present crude and undigested
upon the subject, but I knew her tastes
pointed that way."</p>

<p>"So Clara and Kerrison are to marry, are
they?"</p>

<p>"You may truly appeal to me, my love, for,
indeed, you have little part in your children's
prospects. Yes, I have decided upon Kerrison
and Clara. No alliance can compete with those
which will be celebrated on Thursday, but I
bear in mind the old proverb, 'marry your sons
when you will, but marry your daughters when
you can.' Ripley is the next eligible situation
in Shropshire, now Hatton is secured. If Clara
will only check her temper! I am sure I have
lectured enough upon the subject, and I tell her
four or five weeks of gentleness is all I ask at
her hands."</p>

<p>"Gertrude, you are wrong, you are wicked,"
exclaimed Sir John, for once rousing himself
into determination, and rising from his chair,
"I have been weak and wicked myself in allowing
you such uncontrolled liberty over my
children's minds, and, God help me, I shall have
reason to repent it too soon. I tell you Clara
shall <i>not</i> marry Kerrison. I tell you, Gertrude,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
I will not have her sacrificed to that violent and
coarse fellow at Ripley, to drive a woman into
misery or sin, because your ambition will be
ministered to!"</p>

<p>Her husband's sudden energy was wholly unexpected,
its effect was powerful; her ladyship
sank into the seat he had just quitted.</p>

<p>"Really, Sir John, your violence kills my
poor nerves. I am not equal to contend against
such dreadful exhibitions of temper. My poor
constitution requires perfect tranquillity, almost
amounting to total silence, and these explosions
of passion do me a great deal of harm. Indeed,
Sir John, you have overpowered a poor nervous
creature." His lady's hands trembled as she
spoke, her voice faltered, and the tears coursed
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Did Sir John Wetheral ever resist his lady's
pleading when it took the form of suffering, and
spoke in the silent eloquence of grief? When
did he ever create a sorrow, or cause a heartfelt
reproach, without enduring far greater disquietude,
from the knowledge of having given
pain! He took his lady's hand, and bent kindly
over her.</p>

<p>"Gertrude, this is sad work, and the consequences
of my weak indulgence will be sadder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
still. I have given way to you in every wish of
your heart, and submitted my better judgment
to your tears, till my authority has passed away,
and I am a cipher in all affairs connected with
my children. In this particular, however, I
will be heard and obeyed. I will not allow of
a distant allusion to Clara's marriage with Sir
Foster; and the instant I believe, or have reason
to <i>suspect</i>, any private attempt to draw Clara
into such a hateful connection, that instant I
will remove my family from Wetheral, and
reside in Scotland."</p>

<p>"My head! my poor head, Sir John! Send
Thompson to me, my love, for my brain seems
on fire! I declare men are so brutal, women's
hearts should be cut out of wood. I am quite
unfit for company to-day."</p>

<p>Sir John did not ring for Thompson: he had
much to say, now that the indolence of his
nature was roused into effort, and his mind
dwelt with anger upon the meditated sacrifice
of Clara.</p>

<p>"Never mind company, my dear Gertrude;
I wish all company had been spared this week.
The few days which intervene between the
present hour and my poor girl's wedding-day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
should have passed in domestic privacy and reflection
on their parts."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral's distress and emotion allowed
<i>herself</i> no moment for reflection. She hastily
exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The less they think about it, poor things,
the better!"</p>

<p>"This is a fearful idea, Gertrude. If you
conceive matrimony to be a leap which only the
ignorant should take, you condemn yourself in
your own plans. A husband-hunting parent,
who draws a veil before the victim's eyes, and
leads it blindfold to the altar, is a creature to
be feared and hated."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral's astonishment at this remark,
pronounced with energy by her husband, produced
total forgetfulness of hysterical assistance.
Her anxiety to remove blame from her measures,
gave seriousness to her manner, but dispelled
for the moment all idea of having recourse
to fictitious aids. Her lips quivered, but
not a tear flowed.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Sir John, I am grieved to be supposed
to sacrifice&mdash;to sell my poor children. I
seek their good, I wish them to marry well, as
I married myself, but you are harsh to call them
victims. I have done my duty by them; I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
obtained excellent establishments for my three
eldest, and received congratulations from my
friends. I really cannot receive your reproach."</p>

<p>"Then why are they to dissipate thought,
Gertrude, and fly from reflection?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know, my love. One is
not always prepared with reasons in an instant:
marriage brings cares. They will have the same
anxieties about their children's establishments
that I have endured. I suppose that was my
meaning. I really can't tell; but you frighten
me with such violent expressions."</p>

<p>"Gertrude," said Sir John, seriously, "let all
painful thoughts and subjects be banished between
us. I exact one promise from you."</p>

<p>"My dear love, I never made a promise in
my life."</p>

<p>"Then let it be made now, and stand in your
mind in its singleness and sacred meaning."</p>

<p>"A promise would overcharge my heart, and
burst from my lips, Sir John. I hate promises."</p>

<p>"Yet you promised at the altar, Gertrude,
to love and honour, and obey your husband."</p>

<p>"These are words of course, love, and mean
that people are to jog on as well as they can
together: but what do you require in the shape
of a promise?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"I require your assurance that you will for
ever renounce all idea of a son-in-law as far as
Sir Foster Kerrison is concerned."</p>

<p>"Do you know, love, I see the hand of Boscawen
in your determined dislike of Kerrison.
That man has enormous influence with you;
and when he married a woman young enough
to be his granddaughter, it ought to have
silenced him upon the subject of matrimony.
Lady Ennismore has heard my reasons in favour
of Sir Foster, and it was but yesterday I was
speaking upon the subject with her ladyship.
Lady Ennismore has returned in high feather
from Bedinfield, my love, and looks nearly as
young as Julia; does she not? She assured
me Thursday would be the brightest day in her
calendar of pleasures. I am sure it will be a
day of proud delight to me!"</p>

<p>"I will not allow you to include Sir Foster
Kerrison in the bridal party, Gertrude. I
wish you to understand that I object to every
species of intimacy with the Ripley family."</p>

<p>"My dear John, why did you not express
your wishes earlier? I have indeed asked that
pretty, cheerful creature, Lucy Kerrison, to
spend a few days with Clara when she loses her
sisters, and I felt obliged to include her father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
in the wedding arrangements. I am sorry your
odd ways of thinking prevent so many agreeable
circumstances from becoming valued, but so it
is, and I cannot decline Sir Foster's society
without a cogent reason to apologise for my
change of manner."</p>

<p>"I only object to the man on Clara's account,"
replied Sir John, considerably annoyed
at the intelligence.</p>

<p>"What nonsense, Sir John! Do I insist
upon the girl's falling in love, or do I lay violent
hands upon the owner of Ripley?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, Gertrude, but I object to
your eternal plans and man&#339;uvres, which tend
to the same effect."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral kissed her hand playfully.</p>

<p>"Avaunt such notions! A mother is a very
different being from a father. One is all tenderness
and anxiety for the future; the other dreams
heavily, and not always wisely, over the present.
Look at Chrystal there, sitting bolt upright, with
her hair in such masses, and her throat covered
up like the picture of Heloise. You find her necessary
to your amusement now, but you are blind
to her future advantage. Who will ask for a
wife from the alarming precincts of your bookroom?
Who will care to please a girl brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
up among authors, full of self-importance, and
whose conversation will preclude her from
pleasing others?"</p>

<p>"Christobelle is a very agreeable companion,"
was her father's reply.</p>

<p>"She will do for old Leslie's nephew, perhaps,"
observed her ladyship, listlessly. "Kerrison
says they have got him into Dundonald's
ship."</p>

<p>A short silence ensued, and Lady Wetheral
quitted the room, unshackled by any definite
promise upon the subject of Sir Foster Kerrison.
Sir John sank again into tranquil employments,
satisfied that his sentiments were made known,
and that henceforth, when the bustle of the
double marriage should subside, the tide of
gaiety would ebb, and Wetheral Castle become
a scene of calm and domestic cheerfulness.
Then all this communication with Ripley must
terminate, and Clara would not be subjected
to the constant society of Sir Foster Kerrison.
This happy vision lulled Sir John Wetheral
into present security, and his mind dismissed
the subject from its consideration.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed Isabel's delight at the
daily party which met in the splendid dinner-room
at Wetheral. Nothing could be more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
delightful to her imagination than the scene
which presented itself to her view each day
after the fatigues and annoyance of a long morning
passed in her husband's dressing-room.
When the six o'clock bell rang in the assembled
guests, and warned them to their toilette, Isabel
emerged from her labours, and, with the wild
delight of a girl emancipated from a boarding-school,
she flew to her room and prepared for the
exquisite amusement of the evening. It is true,
she was constrained to enter the drawing-room
leaning discreetly upon her husband's arm, and his
tall figure hovering round her chair, checked for
a time the exuberance of her spirits, by his close
and anxious watchfulness; but her eyes feasted
upon the countenance and dress of those around
her. Compared with Brierly, this alone was
happiness. She looked beamingly upon her
sisters, and complacently at the gentlemen, who
were so soon to carry them from her sight. She
never tired of watching Miss Wycherly, and
her beau, Charles Spottiswoode; the former delighting
her with the oddity of her remarks, and
the latter full of agreeable entertainment.</p>

<p>Wholly wrapt up in the bustle of the scene,
Isabel forgot the plodding disquietude of the
morning, and utter oblivion closed over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
studies which Mr. Boscawen vainly hoped would
reach her taste and improve her mind: her soul
was dedicated only to simple subjects, and the
warm-hearted Isabel acknowledged no desire
beyond the delight of seeing happy faces and
hearing kind remarks. Life to her was a blank,
if it brought other sounds than affectionate
greetings, or produced other objects than smiling,
well-dressed individuals.</p>

<p>During dinner, Isabel's eyes feasted silently
upon her friends; but when the ladies rose to
quit the dinner-room, and her spirit became
disenthralled by the door closing upon Mr. Boscawen,
then did her speech burst its enclosure,
and revel in unrestrained freedom. The day
preceding the nuptial morning Isabel was in
very high spirits, almost as unsubdued as in the
days of her singlehood: even Mr. Boscawen
could scarcely repel the vivacity of her remarks,
though he stood tall and grim before her,
his dark eyes fixed upon her face, and his strongly
marked eyebrows lowering at the rapid remarks
which passed her lips. <i>Gaieté de c&#339;ur</i> played
in her eyes that evening, in spite of her silent,
stern-looking attendant; and, when the ladies
withdrew, Isabel caught Miss Wycherly's arm
in their progress to the drawing-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Miss Wycherly, now I've got
away from Mr. Boscawen, I have so much to
say, and I must say it all before he leaves the
dining-room, you know! Well, how beautiful
Lady Ennismore looks, and what a lovely ornament
in her hair! I wish Mr. Boscawen would
let me wear ornaments! I have been teasing
him to allow me to wear a feather to-morrow-morning,
but he replies in some unaccountable
language, which I suppose means 'no.' I want
to ask the girls if they are frightened about
to-morrow: I was not a bit alarmed. If I had
known, though, how little I was to be mistress
of Brierly, I would not have married."</p>

<p>Isabel flew to her sisters, on reaching the
drawing-room, without waiting any reply from
Miss Wycherly.</p>

<p>"Now, I want to know if either of you feel
frightened. I only laughed, if you remember.
Lady Ennismore, won't Julia be very happy?"</p>

<p>"I trust so," replied her ladyship, smiling,
and obligingly pressing Julia's hand between
her's. "My daughter will repose on flowers,
if a wish of mine has power to confer such a
destiny."</p>

<p>Julia turned her head towards Lady Ennismore;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
joy and affection sparkled in her eye, but
she did not speak.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are so charming, dear Lady Ennismore,"
exclaimed Isabel&mdash;"how I wish Mr.
Boscawen would make <i>me</i> repose on roses, and
leave that horrid 'Universal History,' which
puzzles me to death. I don't think you are in
spirits, my dear Anna Maria; but you need not
be afraid of Tom Pynsent, I'm sure&mdash;he was
the very best partner I ever had. I'm sure Tom
will spoil you. He allowed me always to call
the same country dance, though I know he would
have preferred any other. <i>You</i> need not fear,
my dear Anna Maria. I shall ask Mrs. Pynsent,
to-morrow, if any body need fear dear Tom.
Oh, Miss Wycherly, that is the very sweetest
comb I ever saw&mdash;and my blue silk looks so
dowdy by the side of your darling dress, Miss
Spottiswoode!"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral approached Isabel, and complimented
her upon her improved looks during
her stay at Wetheral.</p>

<p>"Oh, do you think so, mamma? I know I
wish I was not in the family way, for I <i>must</i> be
confined at Brierly, Mr. Boscawen says; and
the place is so large and dull.&mdash;Anna Maria, I
wish I was going to Paris with you&mdash;any where,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
to get out of Miss Tabitha's way. Oh, Julia, I
hope you won't be in the family way soon, for it
is terrible to be such a size, and your figure is so
lovely."</p>

<p>"Ring for coffee, Chrystal," said Lady Wetheral,
in gentle tones, but suffering acutely
under the laugh which was raised by Isabel's
speech.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't ring for coffee, yet," cried Isabel.
"I have so much to say, and Mr. Boscawen
will leave the dining-room if he hears a bell.&mdash;No,
don't order coffee, yet. Clara, I must not
utter Sir Foster's name, because Mr. Boscawen
tells me not; but I think I know whose wedding
will be next. I saw him in the avenue to-day!
ah ha!&mdash;I really think you are too handsome for
Sir Foster&mdash;now I am going to make a match
for dear Chrystal."</p>

<p>So ran on the happy, gay-hearted Isabel, perfectly
blind to Lady Wetheral's agony of mind,
and her efforts to turn the conversation into other
hands. Miss Spottiswoode and Miss Wycherly
encouraged Isabel's ingenuous and indiscreet
powers of chat.</p>

<p>"Chrystal," repeated her ladyship, "I am
pining for coffee."</p>

<p>"No, no, I vow you shall not approach the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
bell," cried Isabel, arresting Christobelle's hand
as she prepared to obey the hint. "My dear
mamma, don't be thirsty yet, I have so much to
say. Do you know I have only recovered my
old spirits within these four days, and they will
expire again the moment I set off for Brierly.
If you ring for coffee, Mr. Boscawen will rise up
before me like Samuel at the Witch of Endor's
call, which I read this morning to him."</p>

<p>"Do you really read a chapter every morning,
besides studying arts and sciences?" asked
Miss Wycherly, seating herself on a stool beside
Isabel. "Now, girls, form a circle, and listen
to Mrs. Boscawen's prospectus of married education."</p>

<p>"Prospectus!" replied Isabel, laughing&mdash;"Heaven
knows what that is; but, now you
are all listening, I will tell you every thing.
What merry faces! I wish Mr. Boscawen would
let me fill Brierly with such faces, and allow us
to scamper over the park and feed the deer. I
got old John, one day, to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is old John?" said Miss Spottiswoode,
who formed the centre of the circle.</p>

<p>"The butler, my dear, the old butler.&mdash;I wish
Mr. Boscawen would let me do exactly as I like.
Ah, Julia, Lord Ennismore is not so old as Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Boscawen, so he will be so good-natured!&mdash;As
to dear Tom Pynsent, I know he will let Anna
Maria dance from morning till night. Mr. Boscawen
says married women cannot be too grave,
but he never told me so till I was married. Mr.
Boscawen loves Chrystal; that's one thing, therefore,
she will return with us to that horrible Brierly.
Mamma, we are going to run away with
Chrystal."</p>

<p>"Are you, Mrs. Boscawen?" Her ladyship
spoke languidly, as though she was resigned to
the endurance of all evils, till her son-in-law
should appear.</p>

<p>"Oh yes. Mr. Boscawen told me he should
take away my sister Chrys. She is twelve years
old, now; quite a companion, he says, for me, if
I ever have half her application&mdash;that, I'm sure,
I never shall have. Old John told me&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door opened and disclosed the gaunt figure
of Mr. Boscawen, approaching in the dignity of
extreme height, and large, bushy eyebrows. He
walked slowly and silently towards his young
wife, and stationed himself at the back of her
chair. Isabel became mute.</p>

<p>"You are early, Mr. Boscawen," observed
Lady Spottiswoode. "We were in the first
burst of remarks sacred to our sex."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Make me a participator," he replied, smiling.</p>

<p>"Never," replied Miss Wycherly. "We have
too much freemasonry to admit you behind the
scenes."</p>

<p>"My wife hears no conversation, Miss Wycherly,
which her husband may not share, I presume?"</p>

<p>"La, Mr. Boscawen," eagerly exclaimed
Isabel, turning to her husband, "you don't like
nonsense, and we talk nothing else."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear you confess such folly
and wickedness, my love," replied Mr. Boscawen.
"I had hoped better things."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Boscawen, I don't mean exactly
nonsense. I don't mean what <i>you</i> mean by nonsense.
I only mean, we&mdash;we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you really mean, Isabel?" Mr.
Boscawen took her hand kindly, and meant evidently
to be playful, but it was the donkey attempting
to imitate the lapdog. Isabel coloured,
and withdrew her hand in alarm. Her
husband's shaggy brows concealed the kindly
expression of his eye, as it rested upon her face.</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know, Mr. Boscawen,
what I mean. I don't think I ever mean any
thing."</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen made no reply, but resumed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
his position behind Isabel's chair. An awkward
pause was agreeably relieved by the entrance of
coffee, and shortly afterwards the gentlemen entered
from the dining-room. Tom Pynsent flew
to Anna Maria, as usual. Lord Ennismore
seated himself by the side of his mother.</p>

<p>"Lord," cried Mrs. Pynsent to Lady Spottiswoode,
"I can't find out a single good quality
in that fellow, Ennismore, to attract a girl like
Julia Wetheral. If the poor monkey hasn't
popped himself down by his mother, instead of
his bride. Look at my Tom, now! See how
he rattles and coos to his dove! Why, my poor
Bobby was not such a honey lover as this Ennismore;
and Bobby, you know, would not set the
Thames on fire."</p>

<p>Sir John sat between Anna Maria and Julia,
in silence; he listened with pleased attention to
Tom Pynsent, who was dilating upon the comforts
he had prepared for his young wife's travelling
mania.</p>

<p>"God knows what sort of a figure I shall
cut," he remarked, in his usual stentorian tone
of voice. "I can't fancy much hunting or good
shooting among such thin, whey-faced chaps as
the French; and, as to dogs, <i>they</i> can know nothing
by being spoken to in such a language. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
can't speak a word of French, and Anna Maria
is as wise as myself. I haven't a notion how we
shall get on, but, if my little girl is pleased, I
am content. A man should please his wife, you
know, or he must be a brute. I wish the Ennismores
would join us. Ennismore, my lad, here,
come this way&mdash;it is not too late now to change
your mind and join us in Paris."</p>

<p>Lord Ennismore rose and joined the party,
who had grouped round Sir John and his daughters.
Lady Ennismore followed her son, and
placed her arm carelessly within his. Tom Pynsent
repeated his observation, and Julia gave
her bridegroom a beseeching look, which was
observed by Miss Wycherly. Lady Ennismore
answered Tom Pynsent's appeal, with her sweetest
smile.</p>

<p>"I almost wish we were going <i>en masse</i>, my
dear friends, to enjoy your delightful visit to
Paris. I almost wish the Bedinfield property
was situated on the banks of the Loire, to be
able to snatch moments at the French capital.
My dear Julia will be so occupied in her new
domain, she will not have leisure to sigh for
other scenes; and I must bask a while in her
happiness, before I can allow myself to imagine
I am a dowager, and free to roam about."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps <i>we</i> will go with you!" exclaimed
Isabel, in a moment of excitation, forgetful of
Brierly, of her situation, and of her husband's
tastes. "Mr. Boscawen, I should so like to go
abroad!&mdash;Mr. Boscawen, do let us join Tom and
Anna Maria!&mdash;I should so love to go to a place
where I could not speak a word of the language&mdash;to
see people stare and eat nasty frogs!"</p>

<p>"My dear Isabel!" said her husband, pressing
his hand upon her shoulder, in token of his wish
she should remain silent.</p>

<p>"Well, Tom Pynsent said so, Mr. Boscawen!
didn't you, Tom?&mdash;didn't you say they eat frogs,
and snails, and things alive?"</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen never hazarded a reply to provoke
fresh rejoinders&mdash;he only alluded to Isabel's
state of health, which he feared might suffer from
late hours, and in a tone of voice, soft, yet decided&mdash;a
tone which Isabel never dared to resist&mdash;he
offered his arm, and counselled her to retire for
the night.</p>

<p>"Another hour for Mrs. Boscawen&mdash;let me
pray for one hour only," said Mr. Charles Spottiswoode&mdash;"this
will be our last general meeting!"</p>

<p>"My wife's health is of great consequence to
her friends," replied Mr. Boscawen, mildly, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Isabel rose in dismay. "I must attend to my
wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed I am very well in health, Mr.
Boscawen, though I am rather heavy to look at.
Mrs. Tollemache was much larger than I am,
when she danced a reel, wasn't she, Miss Wycherly?"</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen was deaf and dumb, upon principle,
whenever Isabel began to converse. He
led his wife to her mother, in silence, to pay her
retiring compliments, and Christobelle accompanied
them in their transit. When Isabel was
deposited in her room, Mr. Boscawen began the
evening lecture.</p>

<p>"Isabel, you shock me to death with your
ignorance and indelicacy."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I was not indelicate, Mr. Boscawen.
You are always finding fault, now I am
married to you," sobbed Isabel.</p>

<p>"My love, you should not allude to your
situation before gentlemen, or name Mrs. Tollemache
in that extraordinary way."</p>

<p>"Well, I did not know there was any harm,
Mr. Boscawen! I declare I wish I was not in
any situation at all, for you carry me away from
every pleasant amusement, and it makes this
place as dull as Brierly."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sorry you weep, my love, and find
Brierly so dull. I hoped you would be happy
here, at least, yet you hurt me by complaining
and tears. My dear Isabel, don't be so childish."</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>am</i> a child, Mr. Boscawen. I'm
only eighteen, next Sunday."</p>

<p>"I cannot bear to see you weep, Isabel;"
and Mr. Boscawen hung tenderly over his wayward
wife. "You will do yourself an injury."</p>

<p>Isabel had sufficient acuteness or instinct to
perceive the source of her temporary power, and
she employed the moment to advantage. Her
sobs increased in vehemence.</p>

<p>"I only wished to&mdash;to wear&mdash;one little white
feather&mdash;at my sister's wedding to-morrow&mdash;and
you refused me, Mr. Boscawen."</p>

<p>"Did I, Isabel? Cease this sobbing, and you
shall have the feather; do, my love. You shall
wear a plume, only be tranquil; as many feathers
as you please, Isabel, only cease weeping."
Mr. Boscawen drew his sobbing wife upon his
knee, and fondled her, like an infant in the arms
of its nurse.</p>

<p>"I only wish for two feathers, Mr. Boscawen;
one to play easily, and a long thing to droop."</p>

<p>"You shall have them, Isabel; now lay down
your little head on my shoulder."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>Isabel sank upon her husband's shoulder like
a wayward child fatigued with its own efforts;
her sobbing gradually subsided, and a low murmuring
noise succeeded, which again softened
into sighs. Christobelle quitted the Boscawens
to return into the drawing-room. Isabel had
gained her point, and the feather was won.</p>

<p>How Christobelle's young heart gloried in the
scene which presented itself to her view the
eventful morning of her sister's marriage! A
large and well-dressed company filled the great
drawing-room to overflowing; and Christobelle's
eye traversed the apartment, resting upon each
group, as they offered themselves to her attention.
She saw Anna Maria pale as when her heart
pined under love unrequited, hanging upon her
father's arm, while her lover stood near her, even
more red-faced and happy than in his day of
acceptance. Julia sat composed between her
bridesmaids, Miss Wycherly and Miss Spottiswoode.
Lady Ennismore was standing immediately
behind her, leaning on her son's arm. Isabel,
bright and sparkling, was closely attended by
Mr. Boscawen; the plume so long coveted,
waving gracefully in her blue silk hat. Mrs.
Pynsent was there, full of happy importance,
evidently taking command of all proceedings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and untired with gazing upon Tom, her only
son, now on the point of leaving England, full
dressed for his journey&mdash;large, loud, and good-looking.
The Tyndals were grouped with the
Kerrisons and Clara. Sir Foster stood silent
and absent, winking his left eye with a nervous
motion, which produced an extraordinary effect.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral glided among her guests with
an ease and grace of manner truly bewitching.
No one could have supposed her heart was swelling
with triumph at the events which were
shortly to deprive her of the society of two children,
or that her present attention was deeply
fixed upon Clara and Sir Foster Kerrison. Every
turn of the baronet's countenance was eagerly
noted by her acute eye; and though, to common
observers, Sir Foster was looking stupidly before
him, winking his eye, and tapping his leg
with a cane, her keen perception drew conclusions
from impossible things, and it added increased
graciousness to her insinuating manners.</p>

<p>Far less satisfied was Sir John Wetheral's
mind, as he glanced from Tom Pynsent to the
effeminate figure of Lord Ennismore, and thought
of Julia's futurity with a man whose mind appeared
to be as imbecile as his person was unmanly.
Christobelle could trace his thoughts in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the expression of his eyes, now gazing with
pleasure upon Anna Maria, and anon resting
mournfully on his beautiful Julia. Christobelle
was too young to sorrow with him, or understand
the deep feeling of his mind; but the remembrance
of his expressive emotions often
came over her in after-life, when experience had
enlightened her in suffering, and when the bitter
pangs of parental disappointment were more
clearly understood.</p>

<p>There was a pause of some moments, after the
general hum of a first meeting had subsided, as
though all parties awaited a summons to the
chapel, which in Wetheral Castle still remained
untouched by the hand of time, since the days
of the seventh Henry. It was a large, and generally
well-filled pile of building, many of the
nearer neighbours preferring to attend Wetheral
Castle for its accommodation in point of distance,
and perhaps with reference to the gay
luncheons which awaited their return into the
great hall. The deep silence was broken by
Mrs. Pynsent.</p>

<p>"Here, hallo! what are we waiting for?
John Tyndal has been in his canonicals this half
hour. Now, Sir John Wetheral, will you lead
Anna Maria? Tom, you be hanged; not so fast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
stupy; take Miss Spottiswoode. There you go!
Hoy, Charley Spottiswoode, leave Pen, and trot
by the side of Mistress Boscawen."</p>

<p>"My wife is under my own charge, thank
you," said Mr. Boscawen, bowing smilingly to
Mrs. Pynsent.</p>

<p>"Lord, what an ass! Here, Sir Foster, you
have tapped a hole in your trowsers with that
cane; do move on with Clara Wetheral; she is
Anna Maria's bridesmaid. Don't keep humming
a tune, my good fellow&mdash;get on."</p>

<p>Sir Foster passed on as he was directed, but
he took no notice of Mrs. Pynsent's address.
He went forward, humming an air, and winking
his eye. Clara leaned upon his arm, in white
muslin and satin. Never had she looked so very
handsome. Perhaps Sir Foster operated as an
excitement to her powers of captivation. If a
woman could charm Sir Foster Kerrison, she
might animate an image of clay; but Clara
liked to be spurred on by difficulties.</p>

<p>Tom Pynsent's hunting propensities lay fresh
and green at his heart, in spite of circumstance,
and a bouquet of geraniums, which bloomed in
the button-hole of his coat; for, perceiving
Christobelle following the train without a partner,
he turned good-humouredly to Henry
Tyndal, and called out,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whip in the tail-hound, Harry, and take
her to kennel." Christobelle was accordingly
escorted into the chapel by Henry Tyndal.</p>

<p>The ceremony ended, which gave Anna
Maria for ever to Tom Pynsent, and Julia
was saluted Lady Ennismore. Lady Wetheral
had reached the summit of her wishes.
Which ever way her eye directed its glance,
there was glory and triumph. Her two eldest
daughters were become head-stones in the
county, and Clara was stationed by the side of
Sir Foster Kerrison. Could all these things
be?</p>

<p>A magnificent breakfast awaited the nuptial
<i>cortège</i>, but Sir John Wetheral would not appear
at the crowded tables; he retired to his
study after the ceremony had concluded, desiring
to take leave of his children in the privacy
of his own place of refuge. Christobelle remained
with him during the <i>déjeûné</i>, and Mr. Boscawen
was deputed to take his place in the scene of
festivity.</p>

<p>Anna Maria appeared in a quarter of an hour,
to receive her father's blessing ere she quitted
his roof for some months, and his paternal care
for ever. Her father kissed her glowing cheek,
and bade her depart in peace. "You have married
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
a good man, and a religious man, my dear
child; therefore you will be free from the
stings of reproach. The trials of life must fall
to your share, but there is one who will kindly
share your troubles, and watch over you." He
turned to Tom Pynsent. "I give you my child
with great satisfaction and pride. I give her
to you innocent and good; bring her home untainted
by the vices of a foreign land." Anna
Maria bent her knee, and received her father's
blessing with streaming eyes. She was hurried
from his arms into the travelling-carriage which
was to convey them to the coast. The gentlemen
were all assembled, examining its form and
workmanship: but she was silently assisted into
her new equipage by her brother-in-law and Mr.
Wycherly. They respected her emotion, and
forbore to increase it by addressing one word of
compliment. Tom Pynsent followed, but his
progress was arrested by the solicitude of his
mother, who had rushed to the door to look once
more upon the athletic form of her beloved son.
Recollections of long-past days of parental solicitude
overwhelmed Mrs. Pynsent's heart, and
produced a flood of tears as she whimpered forth,
"I say, Tom."</p>

<p>Tom advanced, and shook hands for the third
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
time, besides offering every filial consolation over
again.</p>

<p>"Steady now, mother&mdash;steady: go it at a
hand-canter, and don't be disheartened. Take
care of my father, and see to the dogs and colts.
Let John Ball exercise Longshanks, and look
well to the mare. We shall be back to Pen's
wedding."</p>

<p>"Come, none of your jibes, you rascal," cried
Mrs. Pynsent, smiling through her tears; "how
could I guess who Pen cared for, with her wiffering
manners? Well, I will look after your
concerns, Tom, but how shall I get on with only
Bobby? When will you be home, Tom, and
when shall I see you again in Shropshire, and
what will become of me till you come back?
You are leaving your parents when they most
want you, Tom." Mrs. Pynsent's grief became
audible; and Mr. Wycherly, waiving his nephew
into the carriage, endeavoured to lead his
sister from the spot.</p>

<p>"It's no use, Bill; you'll never get me
away till I have seen the last of my Tom.
Anna Maria, take care of Tom, and bring him
safe back."</p>

<p>The carriage rolled away, and Mrs. Pynsent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
gazed till a turn in the avenue concealed it from
her sight; she turned to Mr. Wycherly.</p>

<p>"Take me away now, Bill, and don't speak
a word. Put me into my coach, and send Bobby,
for I'm done up."</p>

<p>Mr. Wycherly did all and every thing his
sister could wish. She was conducted to her
"coach," as she always designated the phaeton,
weeping violently, and "Bobby" took his place
by her side without offering a remark, or hazarding
a word of consolation. The Hatton
carriage drove off, but poor Mrs. Pynsent's sobs
were heard distinctly for some time above the
tramp of the horses' feet, as they paced down
the green turf of the avenue.</p>

<p>The Bedinfield carriages now drew to the
door, and Julia was to depart to another home,
as her sister had done before her; but though
her destiny appeared more brilliant, though all
earthly advantages conspired to render her fate
even more envied and enviable than that of Mrs.
Tom Pynsent, there was a mournful silence
among her friends, and the voice of congratulation
sounded low and melancholy.</p>

<p>Smiles and happy prophecy had gladdened
Anna Maria's departure; but no one ventured
to say that Julia had won a matrimonial prize.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
No one could confess their heart was not heavy
when they saw that young blooming girl led
away by Lord and Lady Ennismore&mdash;a peeress
and a bride. Miss Wycherly sprung towards
her friend as she bade them adieu, and burst into
tears. "Julia," she said, in a serious and touching
tone, "you appear beyond earthly assistance&mdash;far
beyond human cares; yet we know not
what is to be. Julia, in weal or woe, in evil
report or good report, Lidham and its inmates
are yours for ever."</p>

<p>"Amen," responded Charles Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>Julia paused, struck by the solemn tone of
her friend's affectionate speech: her lip quivered,
and the colour fled from her cheek.</p>

<p>"Penelope, I know you love me, and I hope
our meetings will ever be in undisturbed and
happy friendship, but your manner is foreboding
of evil."</p>

<p>"I have a pain at my heart, Julia," replied
Miss Wycherly, pressing her hand upon her
bosom; "but it will pass away. I have a severe
pain <i>here</i>, but I trust it will never visit your
warm heart. Julia, may you be the happiest of
the happy! but, in all changes, remember Penelope
Wycherly, whom you served in her need."
Miss Wycherly threw her arms round Julia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and the two friends embraced in silence. Lady
Ennismore interfered.</p>

<p>"This is a sad specimen of congratulation,
my dear Miss Wycherly, and my daughter will
be made ill by these agreeable, but hurtful
phrases. Ennismore, lead your bride to her
father; and we will take possession of our
jewel, lest melancholy faces dispirit her mind.
Lady Wetheral, I believe we are now preparing
to carry away our darling."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral's eyes sparkled with more
than triumphant delight, as Julia was led into
her father's study; she followed mechanically
in the wake of the two Lady Ennismores, and
her step sounded proudly as she remembered
that her daughter now was numbered among the
great ones of the land. Sir John only considered
that his child was the wife of a man he
could not love, and the daughter-in-law of a
woman he did not esteem. The full tide of affection
rushed to his heart, but became unutterable
from his lips. He could only press Julia
to his bosom; he could not tell her, his mind
was happy in the prospect which was before her,
but he bade God bless her in spirit, and his embrace
spoke volumes.</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly did not intrude upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
sacred scene; but she was stationed in the hall
to gaze upon her friend, and watch her movements.
Charles Spottiswoode stood near her,
but his accents of kind and fond interest were
unheeded by Penelope. As Julia emerged from
the library, and proceeded towards the hall-door
with her new relations, her mother and the Boscawens,
Miss Wycherly fixed her eyes upon her
friend's pale countenance, and exclaimed, "Julia,
you are going; remember my last words, my own
dear friend&mdash;in all changes, remember me and
mine!"</p>

<p>Julia was speechless, but she extended her
hand, which Penelope covered with kisses, and
resigned with reluctance to Lord Ennismore.
"There, my lord," she exclaimed with energy,
"take my friend, since it must be so, but you
will not love her as I do, or understand her
warm heart as I prize it! I shall be ever with
you, Julia, in spirit, and my friendship shall be
a buckler in time of need. Farewell, my own
dear friend!"</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly left the hall, and watched
Julia's departure through a window more retired
from observation. There was only Charles
Spottiswoode to listen, and to him her lamentation
was addressed. She told her lover all her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
fears and all her thoughts respecting Julia's
marriage; the melancholy idea took possession
of her mind, that Lord Ennismore was unsuited
to her friend's character, and, though there was
nothing tangible in his lordship's behaviour to
elicit a strong objection, there was a decided
difference in his character, a manner totally opposed
to the character and kindly bearing of her
cousin Tom, which must affect every body's
mind and opinions. She had an ominous foreboding
that Julia would be unhappy, and never
would she marry Charles Spottiswoode, unless
he would swear, under all reports, under all
circumstances, to receive Julia Wetheral at Lidham;
yes, though she became a worthless thing,
poor, miserable, and contemptible. "Swear it
to me, Charles," she cried, "swear it now, ere
the carriage-door closes on my friend, and carries
her from my sight!"</p>

<p>"I do, Penelope," replied Spottiswoode,
kindly. "Lady Ennismore will find me her
warm friend in every trial; but, why are you so
fearful and foreboding <i>now</i>? Why do your
fears gain such influence and mastery at this
moment of time, when her heart is calm, and <i>his</i>
affection is undisputed?"</p>

<p>"God help me, Charles! but, as Julia came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
from the library just now, she looked like a
lamb led to the slaughter. Did you read
the expression of Lady Ennismore, the mother's
eyes?"</p>

<p>"I did not observe her. I was watching
<i>your</i> eyes, Penelope."</p>

<p>Miss Wycherly heeded not the words which
at another time would have soothed and pleased;
she became restless as Julia lingered on the
steps with her mother, and her desire was to
see Julia once more before she quitted Wetheral,
to embrace her yet again, and repeat
offers of kindness, which must be totally useless
to Lady Ennismore, though they relieved her
heart to utter them. Charles Spottiswoode
urged her to remain, and avoid giving renewed
pain to her friend, who had felt evidently struck
by the ominous farewell; but Miss Wycherly
would hear no objection to her anxiety. She
advanced hurriedly to the door, but Charles
stood before her, playfully holding her hands,
and entreating her to resume her seat. The
little strife of lovers did not last many moments;
the sound of carriage-wheels caused Miss Wycherly
to rush past her companion, and enter the
hall. Julia was gone.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>The gaiety of Wetheral was not much interrupted
by the marriage of its most influential
members. Lady Wetheral lamented the loss
of her daughters, and often in public alluded to
her solitary hours of grief; but she was indefatigable
in her efforts to amuse Miss Kerrison
and Clara; and, though her lips breathed sorrowful
words, her eyes and attention exclusively
belonged to Sir Foster Kerrison. Her ladyship
laboured to maintain "that no passion could be
more selfish than sorrow," and she took credit
to herself, "that, in despite of low and sad feelings
which prompted her to remain at Wetheral
in silent meditation, <i>she</i> had never given way to
her wishes. Indeed, she felt the claims of others
upon her time and attention; and, though her
heart did hope Clara might remain single for
some years, to be her companion, yet it was her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
duty to chaperone her to the amusements which
her youth expected, and, perhaps, required. All
young people loved vivacity, and, though some
parents forgot the days of their own youth, and
checked the happy views of their children, <i>she</i>
would not shrink from a mother's duty." With
these impressions of "duty," Lady Wetheral
was fully employed in escorting Clara and her
young companion to every public amusement;
and Wetheral still continued the scene of festivity,
and the arena of matchmaking, as it had
ever been, since the day Mrs. Tom Pynsent
made her <i>début</i> in public.</p>

<p>However easily the tastes of young men might
bend to Lady Wetheral's flattering lips, combined
with her daughter's attractions, there was
some cleverness required in guiding Sir Foster
Kerrison to the desired point. His silent manner,
and provoking absence of mind, perpetually
defeated the mother's purposes, but her spirit
rose superior to all annoyances. "It might and
would take time to throw fetters upon a man
who forgot every word or engagement of the
previous half-hour, but perseverance must level
every impediment. Clara was very young, and
patience must be severely taxed, if people were
resolved to carry a favourite wish into operation."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Clara had not such a provision of that
precious gift as her mother possessed, and it
required constant watchfulness on her part to
subdue the appearance of irritability before the
object of her wishes. Her mother, too, watched
over the unquiet spirit, and diverted its attention
in the time of need. One day, Clara became impetuous
upon the subject. Sir Foster never
called at Wetheral without a special invitation;
and how was she to manage a great, stupid
creature, who neither saw nor felt attentions?
Lady Wetheral smiled.</p>

<p>"My dear girl, patience! Sir Foster must be
managed, and if you will only leave the affair in
my hands, all will be well. Do not, I beseech
you, look so very cross; the sight of temper
drives away all men who are not actually in love,
and perpetual good-humour is a perpetual attraction."</p>

<p>"How can I keep any temper with such a
heavy mass of human nature?" exclaimed Clara,
scornfully.</p>

<p>"Don't call names, my love; I am going to
tell you. Do not give yourself any trouble, only
look pleased and pleasantly at Sir Foster; I
will effect the rest. Some men are rather dull,
but absence of mind requires skill only in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
parties concerned. I do not think Sir Foster
dull; absent only&mdash;very absent; but perhaps
that may operate in our favour."</p>

<p>"In what way?" asked Clara, inquisitively.</p>

<p>"Never mind, my love, look pleasantly at Sir
Foster, and leave the minutiæ to me. We
must lead him gently and gradually to make
Wetheral a daily resting-place; and while Lucy
is here, it can be done. Pray, Clara, endeavour
to check your temper before Lucy. I should
not wish her to report unfavourably of your manners
at Ripley; so <i>much</i> depends upon your
trying to appear good-humoured&mdash;do, my love."</p>

<p>With evident painful effort, Clara did manage
to conceal her irritable nature from the particular
observation of her friend Miss Kerrison,
who was the main spring of that machinery
which was to involve her father. To Lucy
Kerrison Lady Wetheral directed the most flattering
attentions, and offered the most agreeable
series of parties of pleasure; to her young and
unsuspicious ear was consigned every compliment
which could lull observation, awaken her
love, and interest her in all Lady Wetheral's
actions. In short, a separation from Clara and
the delights of Wetheral was becoming unbearable
to the heart and imagination of poor Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Kerrison, and her eyes filled with tears of real
sorrow, soon made apparent to her ladyship's
quick apprehension, the regret with which her
young guest contemplated a return to Ripley.
This was, to use her favourite expression, "all
in their favour;" and she mentioned the circumstance
to Sir John in her own way.</p>

<p>"This poor, dear Lucy Kerrison, my love, is
sadly overcome at the thoughts of leaving us.
Clara and herself are exceedingly attached; the
tears rush to her eyes whenever the subject is
alluded to."</p>

<p>"Miss Kerrison is a ladylike, nice girl," replied
Sir John.</p>

<p>"Yes, my love, she is quite the companion
Clara should have. I approve her good and
judicious selection. I wish they may often
meet."</p>

<p>Sir John did not reply, and a short pause succeeded.</p>

<p>"I could almost wish Lucy was going to remain
with us for Clara's sake. If I thought
Sir Foster would not object, I would request
him not to recall her."</p>

<p>"Isabel is still with us, Gertrude; Clara has
her two sisters."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;to be sure&mdash;oh, yes, Mrs. Boscawen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
is here, but she is never visible till the half-hour
bell rings. I see very little of poor Isabel myself,
and Clara still less. Bell is shut up, too,
in the schoolroom, learning to be over-wise and
disagreeable; besides, my love, Bell can be no
companion to Clara. I wonder Sir Foster does
not call to see his daughter! do you know, my
love, he has been but once within this fortnight
to see us."</p>

<p>"His company is not particularly acceptable,
Gertrude."</p>

<p>"Well, Sir John, I only name the circumstance&mdash;I
am afraid we are not very attractive;
however, my love, I will try to extend Miss
Kerrison's leave of absence for Clara's sake."</p>

<p>"Do as you please, my only objection is to
her father being obliged to marry Clara. I have
nothing to produce against his pretty, elegant
daughter: don't let Kerrison marry a daughter
of mine, and I shall not interfere in your plans."</p>

<p>"Oh! my love, I never compel men to marry.
I hope my dear Clara will be my companion for
some years. I feel very keenly my dear Lady
Ennismore's loss, and so I do poor Mrs. Pynsent."</p>

<p>"Why is Anna Maria 'poor,' Gertrude?&mdash;she
has married a good man, and a man she likes."</p>

<p>"She is in a manner banished Hatton," replied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Lady Wetheral, sighing; "I cannot think
her happy while she roves about plain Mrs. Pynsent,
no style&mdash;at least, not the Hatton style&mdash;no
proper establishment, no home, like Lady Ennismore,
who drove off to Bedinfield, like the wife
of a nobleman&mdash;liveries, carriage&mdash;all magnificent!
How I long to see Julia in her glory."</p>

<p>Sir John could offer no counsel which might
check the eager delight his lady felt towards the
good things of the earth; he therefore resumed
his book, and her ladyship wrote, privately, a
most polite billet to Sir Foster, upon the strength
of her husband's concurrence in her wish to
detain his daughter at Wetheral.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dear sir,<br />
</p>

<p>"It will break all our hearts to part with
your lovely Lucy, and Clara suffers so much in
the idea of parting with her friend, that we have
a proposal to make. I will not tell you at this
moment its nature, because I wish to see you.
Ladies, my dear sir, prefer speaking to principals.
May I hope to see you at Wetheral to-morrow
morning?</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">"Yours truly,</p>
<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 2em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<span class="smcap">G. Wetheral</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Clara feared Sir Foster would withstand the
invitation, so blandly expressed, by forgetting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
its existence; but her mother conceived the ambiguity
of its expression would raise a germ of
curiosity in his mind, which even the inveterate
disorder of his brain might not subdue. The
wording of the note was talked over before Isabel,
and explained to her. Mrs. Boscawen could
only entreat Clara not to marry so old a man.</p>

<p>"My dear Clara, Sir Foster will put you into
a schoolroom, as Mr. Boscawen has done by me,
for old men are alike, I dare say. I assure you,
it will be a shocking affair, and I can't give my
consent unless you insist upon it. I can't imagine
any body marrying an old man, and going
to their studies as if they were schoolgirls. Pray
take warning by me, Clara, and don't marry Sir
Foster."</p>

<p>"My dear Isabel, I am resolved to make the
man propose to me. Mamma says I shall lose
caste if I am single, for Anna Maria did not
marry till she was nineteen, and almost past
hope. If I don't take immediately, I shall
become <i>passé</i>; for mamma says my style of
beauty ought to take effect at once."</p>

<p>"You are very handsome, certainly, dear
Clara&mdash;very handsome. Mr. Boscawen says you
are a very beautiful girl."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Clara, smiling complacently,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
"I must be up and be doing. Sir Foster is very
rich."</p>

<p>"Oh! Clara, and so is Mr. Boscawen: but I
never have any money. Once Mr. Boscawen
gave me a guinea, and then took it back again
because I would not keep an account of all I
spent. I bought a shilling's worth of alicampane,
and made myself so ill! However, I did not say
I had bought it; so, as I could not account for
the shilling, I was obliged to relinquish the rest.
Don't marry an old man, Clara!"</p>

<p>"Sir Foster lets every body spend his money,
Isabel."</p>

<p>"Ah, but remember what Mr. Boscawen
promised, Clara! I was promised every thing,
and got nothing. You don't know how disagreeable
it is to be shut up in a morning, reading
and translating."</p>

<p>"I shan't read or translate to please Sir Foster,"
said Clara, with scornful energy. "I
marry upon other principles."</p>

<p>"Well, Clara, only try not to marry an old
man, for I assure you it is a very unpleasant
thing."</p>

<p>"I wonder if Sir Foster <i>will</i> call to-morrow,
Isabel?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure he will: I am sure I should,
if any one asked me."</p>

<p>"Don't name this to Boscawen, Isabel: I
don't wish him to know my intentions."</p>

<p>"Certainly not&mdash;that is, if I can keep it from
him; but he manages to find out all my secrets.
However, I will try to keep this all to myself."</p>

<p>So did Mrs. Boscawen resolutely intend; but
her secret transpired at the touch of her husband's
mental wand. Mr. Boscawen began to talk of
returning to Brierly, the very evening of the
conversation which had taken place between his
lady and Clara, and, after retiring for the night,
he mentioned his intention of leaving Wetheral
the following week. Isabel clasped her hands
in alarm.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Boscawen, not so soon! must we
return so very soon?"</p>

<p>"Why not, Isabel? are you afraid of the
dullness of Brierly?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no," cried Isabel, "but I want to
watch Clara, Mr. Boscawen: I want to observe
something."</p>

<p>"What is it all about?" asked Mr. Boscawen.
"Is your sister engaged in some speculation, or
has your mother decided upon any one whom
your sister is decreed to captivate? I think I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
have stumbled upon the truth, Isabel, by your
countenance."</p>

<p>"How you find things out, Mr. Boscawen!"
cried Isabel, blushing and hesitating; "you
never allow me to keep a secret."</p>

<p>"Then there <i>is</i> one, Isabel. Have the kindness
to admit me into the mystery: a wife should
have no secrets."</p>

<p>"Well, only promise not to tell," said Isabel,
awed by her husband's grave manner and remark,
"and I will not keep the secret to myself, though
I promised to do so."</p>

<p>"Who required the promise, Isabel?"</p>

<p>Isabel became alarmed, and disclosed the plot
upon Sir Foster. Mr. Boscawen listened in
silence, and then coolly made his annotations
upon the subject.</p>

<p>"When a mother plots for a son-in-law, and
her daughter acts upon it, besides implicating a
young married sister, under promises of secrecy,
it is time to take steps towards withdrawing
from such society. I had every intention of
leaving Wetheral next week, but now I shall set
off to-morrow, at twelve o'clock; therefore, Isabel,
give your maid orders accordingly."</p>

<p>Mrs. Boscawen's distress was too violent to be
controlled. "Oh, Mr. Boscawen, how can you take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
me away to horrible Brierly so suddenly!&mdash;how
can you frighten me, and threaten to leave Wetheral
before our month is quite over! I shall never
be confined at all, I'm sure, and Clara will be so
angry!" Isabel sat down, overcome with terror.</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen patiently and kindly explained
his line of conduct to his terrified wife. He
assured her no notice would be taken of her disclosure,
and that no one should suspect the cause
of his departure. He expressed his disgust at
Clara's conduct, but he was silent upon the abhorrence
he conceived to the untired man&#339;uvring
of the mother. He trusted Isabel would become
attached to Brierly in the course of time; it
was a safer home than the infected air of Wetheral;
and, after her confinement, if she fancied
change of air, he would take her to the sea.</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen's observations, in some measure,
pacified the extreme grief of Isabel; but
her night's rest was gone, and she was extremely
feverish in the morning, complaining of painful
oppression and headache. Mr. Boscawen was
fearful his young wife might suffer from the
complicated effects of fear and dislike to returning
home; but he was resolved in his purpose:
nothing now could alter his determination to
carry his lady from Wetheral. He announced
his intention openly at breakfast, and Lady Wetheral's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
polite expression of sorrow fell from her
lips upon a cold and barren soil: no flowers rose
under her gracious shower of compliments.</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Boscawen, you surprise and
grieve me by your resolution: the absence of
Isabel and yourself will throw a deep gloom
around us."</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you," quietly replied Mr.
Boscawen, as he buttered his piece of dry toast.</p>

<p>"Losing three daughters at one fell swoop,
is a severe trial," continued her ladyship. "I
shall miss my dear Isabel every hour."</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen deigned no reply; but Isabel,
pale and without appetite, sat dissolved in tears,
and dared not trust her voice: she feared to displease
her husband by any manifestation of grief,
but her heart was sinking under the fearful
anticipations of Miss Tabitha, and the gloomy
routine of Brierly.</p>

<p>"I suppose Sir John is in his study," observed
Mr. Boscawen, rising at the conclusion of
breakfast.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Sir John breakfasts at seven o'clock,
when people are, or ought to be, fast asleep. I
can't comprehend such ungenial hours and taste.
Surely, if breakfast is ended before eleven o'clock,
there is sufficient leisure for the affairs of life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr Boscawen's disgust rose to his eyes, and
overflowed in the expression of his countenance;
but a strong effort subdued the sentence which
trembled upon his lips. He rose, and quitted
the breakfast-room. When the door closed
upon his awful figure, Isabel's misery burst forth:
she threw her arms around Clara, who was seated
near her, and sobbed violently.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, I wish I had never, never
married!"</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Boscawen," replied her mother,
in very soothing accents, "you are not
aware of what you say. I am sure you would
have been miserable single, and I should have
been tormented to death with an unmarried
daughter always at my elbow. You are very
comfortably and happily married, my love."</p>

<p>"Oh, how can you say so, mamma! I wish I
was Chrystal, to sit with papa, and never be
obliged to do what I did not like! I wish I was
you, Clara, happy and unmarried! I wish I was
a bird, or the cat, or any thing but what I am!"
Poor Isabel wept freely: she proceeded&mdash;"I am
going to be shut up with Miss Tabitha and Mr.
Boscawen, in that large, gloomy Brierly; I must
not laugh, or speak to old John, or see any pleasant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
company. Oh, no one can tell the dullness
and frightfulness of Brierly!"</p>

<p>"My dear Isabel, reflect upon matrimony,
and tell me who you ever saw perfectly free
from care in that state? I consider it a very
proper and natural institution, so very properly
arranged, and so particularly enforced, that I
confess I have no opinion of a woman who does
not marry, if all the comforts of life are secured
to her. If a woman is protected by a handsome
settlement, and those kind of things, she <i>ought</i>
to marry."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said Isabel, languidly.</p>

<p>"I do: I think you married extremely well,
and you ought to consider yourself peculiarly
fortunate. If Mr. Boscawen is rigid in exacting
painful sacrifices from you, remember he was very
liberal in making a settlement; there must be
trials, my dear children. I am a proof that
the happiest matrimony has cares. Your poor
father never assisted me in my anxieties about
you all: I am certain Lord Ennismore would
never have married Julia, if my unwearied efforts
had not domesticated him at Wetheral."</p>

<p>"Tom Pynsent will never contradict Anna
Maria," said Isabel, as the tears sprang again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
to her eyes&mdash;"Tom will never wish my sister
to read!"</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen was heard in the hall, giving
orders.</p>

<p>"Oh, we are going, mamma; I hear Mr. Boscawen
ordering the carriage. I know the tone
of his voice in giving that order so well! how
my heart beats!" Isabel clung to her mother's
arm.</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen entered, and gave his arm to
his pale, trembling wife. "My dear Isabel, I
have arranged every thing; you have only your
father to visit before you enter the carriage."</p>

<p>His lady appeared ready to faint. "Don't
let me see papa! don't let me see papa!" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You are agitated, my love," observed her
husband, putting his arm round her waist, and
speaking kindly. "Do not be flurried, my dear
Isabel, you shall see and speak to no one.
Clara will be kind enough to tell Sir John how
you feel. You tremble very much; try to gain
firmness, my love."</p>

<p>Poor Isabel was placed in her carriage, half
fainting, without the power to speak or move.
Mr. Boscawen was hurt and alarmed for the
effects of this agitation upon his lady's health;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
but his mind was decided to persevere in removing
Isabel. He deputed Clara to explain
to her father how much emotion her sister
evinced at the thoughts of taking leave; and
bowing to Lady Wetheral and Miss Kerrison,
Mr. Boscawen took his place by the side of Isabel,
whose head reclined against the side of the
carriage, nor did she raise it to look her adieus.
She appeared too exhausted and sick at heart to
make an effort of any kind. How differently
she quitted Wetheral upon her nuptial morning!</p>

<p>Sir Foster Kerrison did actually call at Wetheral
some hours after the Boscawens' departure.
Clara was soothed and flattered, her
mother charmed, by the visit. Sir Foster sat
silent till he was spoken to.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, this is courteous, indeed,"
Lady Wetheral began; "I feel much honoured
by your polite attention to my wish."</p>

<p>Sir Foster winked his eye and tapped his
boot, but he did not seem to comprehend the
purport of her ladyship's speech. "Umph, eh?"</p>

<p>"Papa, you received Lady Wetheral's note,
of course?" said Miss Kerrison.</p>

<p>"Eh, what?"</p>

<p>"Lady Wetheral's note, papa&mdash;the note you
received yesterday from Wetheral!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Foster sat winking, but could not remember
any note.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, you received a note, and I am
sure it is in your pocket. Pray, let me look
into the recesses of your enormous pockets?"</p>

<p>Miss Kerrison playfully emptied her father's
pockets, and Lady Wetheral's note appeared
with its seal unbroken, accompanied by sundry
letters, straps, nails, and a shoeing horn. Clara's
eyes flashed indignation, but her mother's smiled
sweetly.</p>

<p>"My dear Sir Foster, I must not complain
of your very absent mind, since I only suffer
with the rest of the world. Upon my word,
this is very amusing! See, my dear Lucy, how
entertaining this assemblage of articles promises
to be!"</p>

<p>Sir Foster stared, while the ladies laughed
over the miscellaneous contents of his pocket.
Clara alone sat dignified and offended. Lady
Wetheral explained the purport of her note,
and begged the company of Miss Kerrison for a
longer and indefinite period. Sir Foster hummed
an air and tapped his boot during her complimentary
and lengthy speech.</p>

<p>"Papa always implies consent when he hums
and taps, Lady Wetheral, so that is delightfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
arranged: but why, papa, did you call here
this morning?"</p>

<p>"Where's Boscawen?"</p>

<p>"They have left some hours, to return to
Brierly, papa. Did you want to see Mr.
Boscawen?"</p>

<p>A smile curled Sir Foster's handsome lip.</p>

<p>"I am sorry Mr. Boscawen is gone then,
papa. I suppose you had some horse in view?"</p>

<p>Another smile and tap of the boot.</p>

<p>"I thought so. But, papa, you will never
read your letters and notes if I do not return
to Ripley; will you?"</p>

<p>Sir Foster winked his eye in silence.</p>

<p>"My dear Lucy," said Lady Wetheral, playfully,
"Sir Foster must bring his letters here
every morning for your perusal and advice."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, papa, that is an excellent plan; is
it not? You must ride over every morning to
be searched, and then you will not require my
presence at Ripley."</p>

<p>Sir Foster sat two hours without speaking,
or appearing to attend to the conversation which
took place between his fair companions. He
sat in the most complete absence of mind, tapping
his boot, which Clara resented by silent
looks of contempt. Miss Kerrison was so intimately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
acquainted with her father's ways that
her chat flowed on undisturbed, till the ormolu
clock struck six; Miss Kerrison then approached
her father.</p>

<p>"Well, papa, it's time for you to return
home; it is six o'clock."</p>

<p>"Eh, umph, what?"</p>

<p>"You must order your horse, papa, and go to
Ripley to dinner."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sir Foster surely will not quit us; we
shall hope for his company at dinner to-day."
Lady Wetheral spoke in earnest and bewitching
tones.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, dear Lady Wetheral, not
to-day. This is papa's way; he always goes on
in this way at some person's house, and I dare
say, having once called here, papa will be
regularly at Wetheral every day."</p>

<p>Her ladyship's quick perceptions saw the
advantage of gaining Sir Foster Kerrison as a
daily visitor; she caught at once the propriety
of allowing him to take his own way in the
manner and time of his visits: she therefore
ceased to pour forth invitations, but, taking at
once a comprehensive view of his character and
habits, Sir Foster was allowed to depart in the
same mechanical form which characterised his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
entrance. Clara's indignation almost threatened
destruction to her plans. She inveighed against
the excessive stolidity of a man who could sit in
a fine woman's society, and yet be ignorant of
her presence! Such a man as Sir Foster might
visit at Wetheral innocently enough, for he had
not the use of his senses.</p>

<p>"My dear Clara," argued her mother, "you
are wrong in all your conclusions. Sir Foster
has peculiar ways, it is true, but I consider
them altogether in our favour. I wish him to
become a daily visitor, under the idea of seeing
Lucy, who assists me most materially without
being aware of it. I wish him to sit as stupidly
as he pleases, and to come whenever he pleases;
only, my dear Clara, don't look so indignant."</p>

<p>"I cannot understand your tactics," said
Clara, sharply. "I can't comprehend how
stupidity and indifference can be considered in
my favour."</p>

<p>"I dare say not, my love; but when you become
a mother, these things will explain themselves.
Give me a little credit for foresight,
I beseech you, in the establishments I procured
your sisters. Be patient, and appear calm,
Clara, till I have decided yours."</p>

<p>Clara became impatient and offended, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
caused her mother infinite vexation and alarm.
She dreaded lest Clara's irritable spirit should
transpire even to Lucy Kerrison: she dreaded
lest her own web should become unravelled by
the very hand she wished to bestow upon Sir
Foster. It was necessary to deal very gently
and delicately with a disposition like Clara's.
She did not possess the gentleness of manner
which was so eminent in Anna Maria, or the
sprightly sweetness of Lady Ennismore. Her
beauty was superior to both sisters, which prepossessed
many in her favour; but her wayward
and powerful temper was known only in her own
home. It was her mother's aim to shield it if possible
from observation. Thompson, who had ever
played a conspicuous part in the family, was at
this time installed into a kind of confidential
friend; and to her Lady Wetheral bitterly
complained of the fatigue and terror attendant
upon her own watchfulness.</p>

<p>"I declare, Thompson, Miss Clara gives me
infinitely more trouble than my three eldest
daughters combined. I am always fearful of
some display of temper occurring in an unfortunate
hour to betray her to gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lady, that would be sad indeed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
I'm sure I am always boasting of Miss Clara's
sweet temper, as far as I am concerned."</p>

<p>"I wish her to be silent and calm in appearance,
yet I am ever upon the watch to soften
Miss Clara's remarks, and explain away offensive
looks. I don't think, Thompson, Miss
Clara will marry soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, my lady, I have heard many remarks
about Sir Foster Kerrison's attentions at my
young ladies' wedding!"</p>

<p>"What remarks, Thompson? what do foolish
people say now?" asked her lady, affecting nonchalance.</p>

<p>"People say Sir Foster is not a very talkative
gentleman, my lady, but then he stood
always close to Miss Clara; I heard too he
called this morning; so people put two and two
together, as they very well may."</p>

<p>"If people calculate so erroneously, they must
expect to be wrong in the sum total," replied
her ladyship, smiling and internally pleased at
remarks having been uttered; "but we shall
see, Thompson."</p>

<p>Miss Kerrison's prediction concerning her
father's way of sitting hours in silence at people's
houses was verified. Having called at Wetheral
to see Mr. Boscawen upon some affair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
connected with horses, and having also remained
his usual two hours with the ladies, unnoticed
and unbored with attentions which required him
to talk, Sir Foster Kerrison, on the following
morning, again deposited himself at Wetheral,
and was allowed, with the tact of a veteran
matron, to sit in a lounging chair, tapping his
boot, and winking his eye without molestation.
Miss Kerrison took an inventory of the stores
deposited in his pockets during the first moment
of her father's entrance, an employment he never
noticed beyond an absent smile; after which
ordeal he was consigned to a half-dozing kind
of existence, till Miss Kerrison warned him to
depart, by assuring him the clock had struck
six. Day after day Sir Foster was found regularly
installed in the ladies' boudoir at Wetheral,
and as regularly did he depart at his
daughter's summons.</p>

<p>Had Lady Wetheral rashly urged Sir Foster
to dine at the Castle, it would have broken
through the habit which impelled him to move
backwards and forwards at stated times, and by
certain sounds; it might too have drawn him
towards new people and other houses. Lucy
Kerrison was perfectly right in her suggestion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
that, having called by accident, his visits might
continue through habit.</p>

<p>There was another advantage attendant upon
Sir Foster's morning lounge. Sir John, who
rarely appeared out of the precincts of his
study, was ignorant of the events which gilded
the pleasures of the boudoir. The study was
far removed from sights and sounds, and the
chapel must be traversed to reach its perfect
seclusion. The windows received light from a
court, walled round, and closed to curious view
by a deep and impervious shrubbery of laurels
and evergreen oaks. In this sequestered part
of the castle, its master loved to pass his mornings;
and how could he suppose his wishes, nay,
almost commands, were of non-effect? Sir Foster
was not seen at his table&mdash;his name was
rarely mentioned at Wetheral&mdash;no visiting-ticket
met his eye&mdash;no allusion was made to recent
visits on the part of his family&mdash;every thing appeared
regular and in its usual order. Sir John
was, therefore, calm, and almost oblivious to the
existence of Sir Foster Kerrison. This was most
favourable to his lady's schemes.</p>

<p>For three weeks, consecutively, this order of
things continued; and only once, during that
period, did Sir John meet Sir Foster within the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
domain of Wetheral; which was, of course, attributed
to an anxiety to see his daughter. Under
that impression, Sir John hastened to do
him honour; and, on the morning in question, he
ushered Sir Foster into the boudoir himself, with
the politeness and consideration due to a gentleman,
and a fond father visiting a beloved child.</p>

<p>Astonishment was depicted in his countenance,
when he beheld his guest, <i>sans céremonie</i>,
take possession of the lounging chair, and, after
placing his hat upon a work-table, begin, as was
his wont, to hum an air and tap his boot, without
offering a word of compliment, or even addressing
the daughter he had ridden four miles
to see. There was something extraordinary, he
fancied, in the quiet smile bestowed upon Sir
Foster by Lady Wetheral, and he was much
displeased at Miss Kerrison's sudden movement
to examine her father's pockets, without bestowing
a word of filial obeisance to a parent she had
not seen for some weeks; yet did the truth escape
his unsuspicious mind. It never entered into his
heart to believe his expressed resolutions were
unheeded. His good taste was shocked at the
style of Sir Foster's entrance into a lady's
sitting-room, and he did not remain to endure its
continuance. He retired again to his study;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
secure, at least, that such a man could never
propitiate Clara, however strongly his lady's
wishes might point that way.</p>

<p>So far all things combined again to favour
Lady Wetheral's plans and hopes. It seemed
as though Fortune went hand in hand with her
thoughts, and that Fate set his seal upon her
wish. Sir Foster's constant visits produced much
remark, and prepared the way for her last stroke&mdash;a
stroke which was to end all further suspense,
and decide for ever the happy fortunes of Clara.
Every event led the way gently and surely. Sir
Foster had walked into the net with his own
free will: he came each day to Wetheral, uninvited;
and her ladyship could affirm, most seriously
and truly, that no effort had been employed
on her side to coerce Sir Foster's intentions.
He had not even been asked to dinner.
He had never been alone with Clara. If he
came to visit his daughter, a parent possessed a
right to demand admittance any where; but no
attractions had been held out to allure him&mdash;no
second-hand influence detained him. Sir Foster
came without invitation, and remained without
any inducements beyond his own pleasure. Sir
Foster, therefore, prepared his own destiny; for
Lady Wetheral, anxious to preserve her daughter's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
peace of mind, thought it now high time to
understand upon what terms they were in future
to meet.</p>

<p>To be so very regularly at Wetheral&mdash;to sit
with herself and daughter daily, uninvited, and
without inquiring for Sir John&mdash;wore an appearance
which the world could express only in
its conventional language, as "paying his addresses
to Miss Wetheral." Young ladies had
feelings, which must be cared for; they had sensibility,
which should not be wounded with impunity.
There was a part which every parent
should act with firmness towards a young girl,
whose affections were trifled with; and she
would undertake the painful task of leading Sir
Foster to explain his sentiments, herself. Clara
was to engage Miss Kerrison, the following
morning, in a walk round the garden, at the
hour of Sir Foster's visit; and Lady Wetheral
would soon penetrate his intentions. If all went
well, the window of the boudoir was to be thrown
open; in which case, Clara was to appear as by
accident. If Sir Foster was very resolute and
ungallant, all would remain closed; but she
would not allow a doubt, in her own mind, to
arise upon the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>At breakfast, on the eventful morning, Lady
Wetheral issued her orders to the butler&mdash;</p>

<p>"When Sir Foster Kerrison comes, show him
into the drawing-room."</p>

<p>Sir Foster was shown into the drawing-room,
accordingly.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
